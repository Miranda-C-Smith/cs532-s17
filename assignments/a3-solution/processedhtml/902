Swapnil Gautam          What stupid app is this?  tell you to grant some permissions but won't tell which ones. Kind of app like these are failures and the reason for me not to try this app. Tried to even open it but even won't open at all.Way to go dumb developers.                            Amazing concept for moviebuffs like me. But it's not so popular right now which is the main point as very few people know about this and as a result , the minimum amount of audience required is not getting filled-in                    Ansari Ashir          It doesn't work for me.it asks me to grant permission for certain things i grant the permission and then it tells that there is problem in my internet connection even when my internet connection is absolutely fine                    Siddharth Jain          Good app. But WhatsApp sharing not working for me.                    Krushnaal Pai          Nice concept but practically I don't think it will work. I personally feel you should tie-up with all other cinema owners like Inox, Big Cinemas, E-Square, Cinepolis and start a Netflix like service where you charge Rs. 500 per month. In this model a user can watch any new movie that hits the theatres any number of times in any theatre of his/her choice, basically it's like a monthly bus/train pass. To prevent abuse, you should block users for that particular month in which they fail to attend the screening more than once.
