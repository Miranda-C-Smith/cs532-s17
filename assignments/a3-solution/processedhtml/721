        Maddie, daughter of Jamie Lynn Spears, is in stable but critical condition.
    
Britney Spears is asking fans to support her family after her eight-year-old niece was involved in a serious ATV accident Sunday.
"Need all the wishes and prayers for my niece," Britney Spears wrote in an Instagram post, following news that Maddie Briann Aldridge is hospitalized, in stable but critical condition.
Maddie, the daughter of Spears' younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears, fell into a pond while driving an ATV on the family's property. She was submerged, "trapped and secured by the seat belt and the ATV's safety netting" until first responders arrived on the scene two minutes later to free her, according to a statement from Tangipahoa Parish police. 
According to Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards, the accident occurred on the family's Louisiana property while Jamie Lynn Spears and her husband, Jamie Watson (Maddie's stepfather), were watching.
