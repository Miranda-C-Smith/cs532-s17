Watch MF DOOM Pay Tribute To J Dilla On The Late Producer’s Birthday
“MOMENT OF SILENCE....”



      By Jordan Darville





















    Happy birthday A video posted by Nature Sounds (@naturesounds) on Feb 7, 2017 at 9:26am PST









            February 7 is the birthday of the legendary producer J Dilla, who died in 2006 from a rare blood disease. This year, MF DOOM acknowledged the born day of one of hip-hop's defining figures with a moment of silence. 
          

            The video was posted by Nature Sounds, the New York record label that have been sharing DOOM's ocean dispatches since 2015 (he's reportedly based in a remote island off of Cuba). That year, DOOM paid his respects to Sean Price after the rapper's unexpected passing.
