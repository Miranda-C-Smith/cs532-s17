With Netflix’s team-up series “The Defenders” coming up later this year, there’s still one more member of the team that hasn’t been seen yet: Iron Fist. That’s all about to change, because “Iron Fist” is coming on March 17.

To herald the final Defender’s arrival, Netflix has released a full-length trailer for the series that highlights everything from Danny Rand’s (Finn Jones) origin to his struggle to take control of his company and his clash with “Daredevil’s” Madame Gao. The trailer also features a lot of Jessica Henwick’s Colleen Wing, a classic “Iron Fist” character that looks like she’ll have plenty to do in the upcoming Netflix series. And, of course, a Netflix/Marvel series wouldn’t be complete without Rosario Dawson’s Claire Temple, who shows up at a few points in this trailer to do what she does best: call out the hero for saying and doing things that make no sense. 


Starring Finn Jones as Danny Rand, “Iron Fist” arrives on Netflix on March 17, 2017. The series also stars “Star Wars: The Force Awakens’” Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing, Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth, David Wenham as Harold Meachum, Jessica Stroup as Joy Meachum, Tom Pelphrey as Ward Meachum and more.
