Sony’s latest smartphone camera sensor can shoot at 1,000fps

Faster than the Sony RX 100 V

Sony is showing off its latest smartphone camera sensor which it says can shoot 1080p slow-motion video at a blistering 1,000 frames per second. The new 3-layer CMOS sensor — an industry first — can capture slow motion video about eight times faster than its competition with minimal focal pane distortion, according to Sony.






The sensor can also take 19.3MP images in 1/120th of a second, which Sony says is four times faster than other chips, thanks to high-capacity DRAM, and a 4-tier construction on the circuit section used to convert analog video signals to digital signals. 

All of that fancy camera talk basically means this sensor blows every camera currently in a smartphone out of the water.  Although the iPhone 7 and the Google Pixel can shoot 1080p slow-motion video at 120fps, they are still miles behind what Sony has reached with its latest sensor. At 1,000fps it even surpasses the Sony RX 100 V, which can only shoot at 960fps.
Given that both Apple and Google use Sony sensors in their cameras, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to capture even more incredible slow-motion video on your phone in the next couple years. And hopefully 32GB phones will be a thing of the past by then as well, as 1,000fps full HD video would eat up your storage space in an instant.
