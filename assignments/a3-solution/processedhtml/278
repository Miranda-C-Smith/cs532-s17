    Harmful caterpillar spreads across Africa Scientists say a caterpillar known as the fall armyworm is spreading at a dangerous pace across Africa. This could mean harsh times ahead for the continent's farmers, since this particular insect is known to have devastating effects on maize crops. Dr Janny Vos works for the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International.Picture: Scholastic Ncube shows the extent of the damage to his maize crop by the fall-armyworms in his field near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The fall armyworms are similar in size, greyish in colour. Credit: EPA/AARON UFUMELI.
