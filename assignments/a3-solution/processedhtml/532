The Croatia international midfielder is set for an extended spell on the sidelines after picking up an untimely knock in Sunday's narrow defeat







Inter have announced that midfielder Marcelo Brozovic has suffered a broken toe.
The 24-year-old, who was substituted in the second half of his side's 1-0 Serie A loss to Juventus on Sunday, was sent for scans after complaining of pain in his right foot.

X-rays have confirmed that he has sustained a fracture and he will likely be forced into a spell on the sidelines.
"Marcelo Brozovic underwent an x-ray on his right foot on Tuesday after he picked up an injury in Sunday's game against Juventus," Inter said in a statement.

"The procedure showed that Brozovic has sustained a fracture to one of the bones in his fourth toe.
"The Croatian's condition will be evaluated over the coming weeks."
'Only Pogba better than Kondogbia'
Initial reports in Italy suggest he will certainly miss Inter's next two matches against Empoli and Bologna, while he is a doubt for the clash with Roma at San Siro on February 26.
Brozovic has contributed five goals and four assists in 20 appearances in all competitions this season, having initially struggled for playing time under former head coach Frank de Boer.
