Reclamation Increasing Releases into Lower American River for Storage Management 
Up to 30,000 cubic feet per second by 4 p.m. Monday
Media Contact: Louis Moore, 916-978-5100

For Release: February 06, 2017
SACRAMENTO, Calif. – The Bureau of Reclamation is scheduled to incrementally increase releases below Nimbus Dam from 15,000 cubic feet per second to 30,000 cfs by 4 p.m. Feb. 6, to manage Sierra runoff. If inflows continue to increase or start to decrease, operational adjustments will be made as necessary and may occur on short notice.     
Folsom Reservoir, located 26 miles northeast of Sacramento, provides water for people, fish and wildlife, hydropower, and environmental and salinity-control requirements in the Bay-Delta.     
People recreating in or along the lower American River downstream of Folsom Dam to the confluence of the American and Sacramento rivers can expect river levels to increase and should take appropriate safety precautions.    
Midnight reservoir elevation and flows from Folsom Dam may be found at Reclamation’s Central Valley Operations Office website at https://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvo/vungvari/wtr_rpt.pdf. Current American River conditions may be found at the Department of Water Resources’ California Data Exchange Center website at http://cdec.water.ca.gov/river/americanStages.html.
