Published on Feb 6, 2017Buy One Here: https://goo.gl/LB41nTStar Wars Meets RC with this Eagle Eye E902 Prober Drone which in our opinion looks a lot like the Speeder Bikes from Star Wars.  Nate has been a life long fan of everything Star Wars, so seeing a drone flying with an actual rider on it made him pretty happy!  Let's have some Star Wars like RC Fun and see how the quadcopter performs!Have we ever saved you money or helped you pick out your favorite RC?

Send it to P.O. Box 361 Ashland, KY 41105FAQ:Q: Can I have a Free RC?A: YES!  We do GiveAways All The Time!  We highly encourage and invite you to enter our contests fairly.  Keep in mind that both Abby and myself (Nate) work Full Time Jobs, pay our taxes, and EARN Everything you see on our channel.  This is a HOBBY that we both share and Enjoy Together.  Nothing in our lives has ever just been Given to either of us without doing something to earn it.  Hard Work goes a Long Way in this world, and we recognize and surround ourselves with those types of people.  Begging, lieing and cheating will NEVER get you anywhere, and is only a quick fix to the real problem.  If you are a youngster, mow lawns!  When I (Nate) was too young for a job, I would mow lawns to get the things I wanted.  After that, I always had a part time job to save up for games and toys and other things I wanted to buy.  RESPECT is still a thing, and you should do something to earn it back for yourself.  Stop Begging for stuff that we worked Very Hard to EARN.  We will gladly give things away for our contests to the people that we feel deserve it.Q: Do you read your comments?A:  YES!  We read nearly every comment on our channel!  Now with YouTube's update, it is Very Difficult to read when someone replies to a comment, which in our opinion is a little stupid.  We will do our best to reply to Real Comments that are not Spammy, Negative, or Beggy, in any way.  If we catch you cussing, put others (including us) down we will most likely DELETE your comment, and if you push your luck we will simply block you.  Keep it positive and you'll most likely get a reply Directly from Myself (Nate) or Abby!Q: How Far / High does it go?A: Generally speaking, 2.4 ghz (which is basically all RC vehicles these days) will fly / drive further than you can see LoS (Line of Sight) and in many cases even further.  We do NOT risk the safety of others on our channel and will not push the range further than we feel comfortable.  If you want to see dangerous flying, this is not the channel for you and you should reconsider what you are doing with your RCs before ever flying again.Q: How Much Is It?A: We link the product that we are talking about in the description box of almost everything we cover.  Abby and I used to say the prices of things in the videos, but in this fast paced hobby with new things coming out every day, prices change and very quickly!  We encourage you to check the link because most likely the price will be cheaper than what we got it for.
