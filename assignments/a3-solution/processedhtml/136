3.0 out of 5 starsDisappointed with purchase


      By
    
Lisa

  Very disappointed, it arrived without instructions, spent ages on the Internet  finding how to use it and by then had wasted about 20 rings. Once mastering how to use  found it only works on thin fabric as clips very short. All in all a great disappointment and waste of money.

5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent product, well built and good snap fastener selection

  Excellent product, well built and good snap fastener selection.  Overall good value for money in comparison to some sets I have seen and the snap fasteners so far seem to be very secure (I've used them on home made children's clothes).Only negative is that never having used one of these before, instructions would have been useful as none were included.  Never having used one I had to utilise online search engines and video tutorials to try and figure it out.  Once I worked it out though it was straightforward to use!The little storage box for the fasteners is also a plus!

  These don't come with instructions but once I'd worked it out its pretty easy. The prongs don't seem big enough to go through thicker materials though but if using on thin materials it's good and the poppers are securely fastened.

  Purchased this to repair a jacket that has lost one of it's poppers. No complaints about the product - Strong well made with plenty of studs - But unfortunately they are too small. My fault.

  Very bad quality. Not suitable for use on toys or children's clothes because they do not attach strongly enough to the fabric. Asked for refund.
