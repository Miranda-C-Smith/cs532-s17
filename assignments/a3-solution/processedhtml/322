DETROIT PISTONS HEAD COACH STAN VAN GUNDY:  (On matching intensity on both ends of floor): “I thought we started the game well. Then we sort of let up at the end of the first quarter but we played a good second quarter. I thought where we really made a step forward was, we’ve really not played well lately to start the third quarter, and tonight we were really good. I was really happy with our starting group, coming out of the start at the third quarter. I thought they did a really good job.” 
(On turnovers): “Yeah, some almost comical ones. We did handle the ball better (16-minute stretch without turnovers). I thought our defense was really good. Other than our turnovers at times, I thought our offense did good things.”   
DETROIT PISTONS GUARD REGGIE JACKSON: (On change from the second quarter to the third): “We were able to get defensive stops and get out and run.  We got some easy baskets and second-chance points as well, but most importantly we were able to get stops.” 
(On turnovers): “It is a little bit of teams getting in to us and making us turn it over and then just us also a combination of us being careless with the ball.  I think we did a little bit better after our early streak of us turning the ball over.  We kind of figured out what they were doing and we were able to reverse the ball and get their bodies moving.”  
DETROIT PISTONS CENTER ANDRE DRUMMOND:   (On the difference between their first matchup with the Sixers): “We came out with energy from the beginning.  We came out with a defensive mindset first.  On both sides of the floor, we played as hard as we could and got ourselves out to a good lead.  We had a tough first quarter, but we turned it around and finished the game out great.” 
(On points in the paint): “We just kept attacking with force, not putting up soft shots.  When we go in there, we have to go in tough and not look for fouls and try to finish the play.  We did a good job of really attacking the basket and trying to finish everything.” 
PHILADELPHIA 76ERS HEAD COACH BRETT BROWN:  (On Pistons screens): “They’re a physical team. That’s what they do. When you look at the veterans on the team, I respect the toughness. I respect that group. Their starters really did a heck of a job on our starting group. We were down tonight. The physical side of that team, especially with their starters, is something I give them credit for.”  
(On what made the difference): “Their physical side of it got the better of us. They have a veteran team. There’s a physical side to their team. There’s a physical side to their center and they were coming off a disappointing loss. We beat them the last time we played them. (Kentavious Caldwell-) Pope didn’t play the last time we played them. There were a lot of things that you worry about coming into this building. For us, to go on the road, you’re reminded, you can go win 10 games like we did in the month of January; that’s what we won all of last year or you can go on the road and lose four in a row and really got some stuff handed to us tonight and a few times on this trip. We’ve got to go back to Philadelphia; we’ve got to learn from our mistakes. I’m so proud of the work these guys put in. They work. There’s not one problem I have at all with their work ethic, with their professionalism. I respect that group very, very much in that capacity. We’ll identify things we need to work on from a coaching staff perspective and deliver it to them and they’ll buy in and we’ll try to move forward back in Philadelphia.”  
PHILADELPHIA 76ERS CENTER JAHLIL OKAFOR: (On issues playing the Pistons): “They have a really balanced roster; a lot of guys just score the ball which is why they have multiple guys in double figures, definitely a tough team. They have a really balanced roster.” 
(On what changed between quarters): “It seemed like in the third quarter we couldn’t make a shot, couldn’t get a stop, and we kept turning the ball over. It really just felt like there was a lid on the rim. We really couldn’t get any shots to fall for us. We’ll go back to Philly tonight, watch film, and try to correct the mistakes we made to make us get so far behind in the second half.”
