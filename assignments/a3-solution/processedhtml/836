X Da Hustla x Mont - Be My(Valentine)

    It's funny how this track actually came about . At first the beat was sent to Skeet Da Yung Poet from X Da Hustla for Forbidden to jump on . But it wasn't fast enough for her . Skeet suggested to give it to Mont , S.D.Y.P 's R&B singer from Philly ; Mont still wasn't sure which direction he should go in . With Valentines Day being around the corner and the entire album being centered around Love & Lust Skeet said Just give them a nice Valentines Day Hook . After X Da Hustla added to it ; it was a rap from there . Together they put together a solid Valentines Day Single .
