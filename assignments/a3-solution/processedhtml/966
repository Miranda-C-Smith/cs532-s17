Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines
To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.
Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?
We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.
Reviews Vision
We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.
Reviews Principles
Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.
Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.
We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.
We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.
Guidelines and Standards for Reviews
These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone. 
Contributions should be travel related. The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.
Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience. Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted. 
All content should be genuine and unique to the guest. Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.
Respect the privacy of others. Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.
The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

266 Guests Loved Their Stay




“The lady that checked us in was very pleasant and helpful.  Our room was not crowded and it was clean.  I liked that we could park in front of our room and not have to carry our luggage upstairs and there was no freeway noise.  Also the property had old and classic cars and  trucks to look at.”

Mary

“We loved the location, the owners of 35 years were So nice, great suggestions to eat. The room was very clean and I could see the owners took great pride in maintaining it. The round bed was amazing and actually comfortabl. Not a five star motel, but pretty darn close. Furniture was very dsted, but I'm ok with that, I prefer charm overy fancy pancy anyway.”

“Nice nostalgic motel, but rooms' capacity in this listing should be revised!”





• Leisure trip


• Family


• Queen Room with Two Queen Beds


• Stayed 1 night



눉I was very disappointed that the only way to book a stay in this motel for 3 people via Booking.com was to book two rooms. In reality, each of those two rooms could take up to four people. Each room had two queen beds. So, we paid for 8 people and there were only 3 of us! As we are a family of three adults, we actually only used one of those rooms, but have had to pay for both! Booking.com should revise this listing immediately.눇I haven't stayed at many motels, but this one was clean and comfortable, and conveniently located on our travelling route around California. Couple that runs it  have been running it for decades and care very much about it. Nostalgic Route 66 details make it stand out from the crowd of chain motels.

눇The front desk agent (possibly the owner) was great. He received us around midnight, but was also there the next morning before 8! We also forgot a nice leather jacket in the room, and they were so caring in calling us, leaving a voice message, and shipping it to us, and providing a tracking number as requested. 
In addition, there are just nice interesting props around the property. Route 66 signs, old relic cars, everything that gives this place personality. Highly recommend!

“Good place if you want a historical/retro experience, but not if you are looking for modern comforts”





• Leisure trip


• Family


• Queen Room with Two Queen Beds


• Stayed 1 night



눉This was a reasonable place to obtain shelter as part of a long drive/road trip, but it is very old and dated, which may have appealed to me when I was young and adventurous, but now that I'm older and with a family, I would rather have had the comfort of a Hampton Inn.눇The lady who owns/runs the establishment was great to talk to, and very helpful.

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.






























Verified reviews from real guests.We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from real, verified guests.


How does it work?




1



It starts with a booking
The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
