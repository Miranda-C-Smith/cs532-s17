Addicting,Awesome but one thing

    So one thing I'm a kid (11) and I'm not aloud to get Facebook and sometimes you need Facebook to get some of the event fish (Valentine's Fish Bugs are problems). I'm just saying I love this game awesome and addicting, it's just u need to fix some bugs and then this game will be 9001/5. You should make the game where u can see other people's aquarium and not need Facebook. also, so we can add them to the friends list. That's it and btw great job with the game and keep up the good work. 👍👍👍👍👍😀😀😀

    Can you guys make it easier to find hidden fish? There are new hidden fish and im trying to figure out how to unlock them but i cant. We need clues to help us find the hidden fish, we need a new update to make this easier.

    Abyssrium is a great game and its actually somewhat stress relieving. One thing is that its name is now Tap Tap Fish and that kind of annoys me. But great game and deserves 5 stars!
