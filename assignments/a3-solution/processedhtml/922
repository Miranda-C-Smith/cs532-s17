Relation Misconceptionship





There are some men that wouldn't have made a vow 
If their women had not taken a bow for approval 
As a man it sucks wanting to be number one
But only becoming first by default
Because I know some men who would be welcoming to the thought
That says "It's a lot better to be first place for a while, than to not be in any space at all"
If everyone should go with their feelings
There might be a lot less need for healing then
So many hearts might not have been broken
And the words spoken about being taken for granted 
Granting that the fact is: we are all human
So it's only right to say the same things for a woman
Some women are wives only because knives look a lot more attractive in the hand
And it's a deal for a man to get married to another man 
So some men rather to walk down the isles with a woman 
Instead of admitting to the lies of what they're doing
Here is the deal, 
The love you receive isn't always real 
It isn't always about how you feel at times
Because most times it's a deception, an illusion that captures your finite perception
While other times it's your perspective that has become deceptive and needs a whole new sense of direction
