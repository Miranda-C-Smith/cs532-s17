I decided because we are a united team." ❤️ pic.twitter.com/c90UE9sGCW— TheMilanBible (@TheMilanBible) February 6, 2017

Reported by ​ESPN, Bacca said, "It just so happened that he took me off and I was angry because we were losing 1-0. I wanted to stay on the pitch and help the team. It was his decision and I had the adrenaline of the game."Right now it is all out in the open, I spoke to him and I was wrong because I was hot-headed and angry. I told the coach that I had made a mistake, I spoke with my teammates to apologise and I will pay for dinner for the team.Montella: Bacca will start against Bologna... if he picks a good restaurant! https://t.co/99JMxdCoJi— Goal (@goal) February 7, 2017

"I decided to do that because we are a united team. Everything was fine afterwards and I spoke to him this morning. There are no problems with the coach. I have to respect his choices and keep working. It is important to have an early chance to bounce back on Wednesday against Bologna."Hopefully the Milan players will take full advantage of the former Sevilla striker's offer and go to the most expensive restaurant in town.
