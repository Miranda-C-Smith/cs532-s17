Kelly was speaking Tuesday at a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing examining the order, which temporarily stopped entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations and also temporarily bars the admission of refugees. A court has blocked the order, but the administration is appealing.
Kelly defended the order saying it will enhance public safety "for all our citizens." Kelly said he believes it is constitutional and that Trump's review of immigration policies is necessary.
