        Simple, one-touch brewing
    

        Create exceptional freshly brewed Coffee or authentic Espresso at the touch of a single button. The capsule is automatically ejected after brewing, with only 15-20 seconds of pre-heating time. The cup support is adjustable to three positions to accommodate different cup sizes.
    





        Two cup sizes
    

        One convenient machine for two cup sizes, 8 oz. Coffee and 1.35 oz. Espressso, via two different capsule sizes: large capsule for Coffee and a small one for Espresso. Each capsule deliver the finest roast and ground coffee sealed in a single serve portion for optimal freshness.
    





        Centrifusion extraction technology
    

        VertuoLine coffee makers use a patented extraction technology developed by Nespresso known as Centrifusion. Just insert a capsule and close the lever — when activated, the capsule spins up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending ground coffee with water and producing the perfect crema to enjoy your favorite freshly brewed Coffee or authentic Espresso.
    





        The Nespresso Club
    

        Order your Nespresso capsules through the Nespresso Club; online, by telephone (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or in one of our Boutiques. Receive personalized advice and obtain technical support for your machine: whatever you are seeking, the Nespresso Club is with you every step of the way.
    

        We also offer a capsule recycling service to all Club Members in the United States.

        Instant enjoyment
    

        Each machine includes a welcome set with 12 Nespresso VertuoLine capsules containing individual aromas. Nespresso Experts have created these highly aromatic and smooth gourmet blends, individually developed to deliver ultimate quality. The result is 14 incomparable Grand Cru experiences, each carefully balanced and roasted to bring out its unique flavor profile.
    





        Nespresso Vertuoline capsule system
    

        The Nespresso Vertuoline capsule system delivers exceptional taste and unique aromas thanks to the preparation of high-quality coffees in hermetically sealed and recyclable aluminium capsules for coffee enjoyment at the highest level. VertuoLine offers 10 freshly brewed Coffees and 4 authentic Espressos, each with varying intensity and taste. Try each Grand Cru to find your favorites.
    





        Automatic blend recognition*
    

        VertuoLine uses an intelligent extraction system that recognizes each Grand Cru blend. Thanks to a barcode on the rim of the capsule, the brewing parameters are adjusted by the machine depending on the selected Grand Cru. There is no need to change settings. This delivers the best in-cup result for your chosen variety – all at the touch of a button.
    

        (*Laser class 1 product)
    





        The Positive Cup
    

        We believe that each cup of Nespresso has the potential to not only deliver a moment of pleasure but also restore, replenish and revive environmental and human resources. In effect, a cup of coffee that can create a greater value for society and the environment.
    

        This is the Positive Cup vision and continues Nespresso's commitment to sustainability in coffee sourcing and consumption.

        Nespresso VertuoLine with Aeroccino Plus Milk Frother
    

        From the pioneers of single-serve coffee, Nespresso VertuoLine is a new system offering freshly brewed Coffee with crema as well as delicious, authentic Espresso. The machine conveniently makes two cup sizes, 8 oz. Coffee and 1.35 oz. Espressso, at the touch of a button. It uses two different capsule sizes: large capsule for Coffee and a small one for Espresso. 
    

        VertuoLine coffee makers deliver a perfect cup of coffee time after time, thanks to Centrifusion, a patented extraction technology developed by Nespresso. Just insert a capsule and close the lever — when activated, the capsule spins up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending ground coffee with water and producing the perfect crema to enjoy your favorite freshly brewed Coffee or authentic Espresso. The machine delivers the optimal in-cup results for each blend using capsule-specific brewing with barcode reading.
    

        The Aeroccino provides a smooth, finely textured hot or cold fresh milk froth for your coffee recipes via an ultra simple and fast automatic system, in a few seconds, without noise or vibration. The Aeroccino also heats milk for your Caffè Latte or Cappuccino.

Experience the Revolution of Coffee. The new Nespresso VertuoLine coffee system provides coffee lovers with a revolutionary way to experience freshly brewed, large-cup coffee with an espresso style crema, as well as an authentic espresso at the touch of a button. Set includes the Nespresso Aeroccino Plus milk frother: rapid one touch preparation of hot or cold milk froth. The new Nespresso VertuoLine revolutionizes the way that coffee is brewed, introducing Centrifusion technology to produce large-cup coffee with crema and espresso with the same high quality, in cup result. Centrifusion provides a system where extraction parameters are individually controlled and optimized for each Grand Cru coffee.

We spend a few hundred a month on Starbucks, CB&TL; and Peets (sadly). We've used keurigs, the Vue and other home pod systems. We were looking for a coffe maker that 1) makes good espresso/latte 2) makes good coffee 3) doesn't require massive clean up and 4) doesn't cost $1200. This one beats all I've tried and meets all the criteria.I'd held off the Nespresso because you have to order the pods and it didn't make regular cups of coffee. Both issues solved. Firstly local boutiques sell the pods and you can order them through the Nespresso app & Amazon with a 2 day delivery. The Virtuoline makes regular coffee. Sweet!About the machines;The Virtuoline is completely reengineered. It takes a bar coded pod (which the machine reads), spins the pod at high speed while injecting over 19 bars of pressure. The result is a very creamy (Crema) coffee or espresso before you even add creamer/milk. Works exactly as they advertise.The Aerrocino plus is my new favorite toy. Somehow it froths milk into either a creamy blend or whipped froth (depending on which whip you use). My wife loves a foamy cappuccino and I like creamy latte's. It delivers every time. Coolest thing, one touch button and go. Simple and consistent. If you want to control the temperature, hear the steaming sound etc and then have to clean the nozzle everytime; you'll want a full espresso machine (ie pay 3 times as much and do 3 times as much work).Pros;* easy to use. Everything is literally 1 touch button.* Easy to clean. Auto eject pod, rinse milk frother. Done.* great performance: cream/milk frother; perfect!* Excellent espresso; vacuum sealed perfectly roasted coffee beans ground and pressurized.* Impressive Crema both coffee and expresso* Well made, heavy duty components.* Good selection of espresso and coffee* Superior customer service* Cost vs other options.Cons;* regular coffee (not espresso) is a little watery (but flavorful) if you don't short the cup at about 6 ounces.* lack of ability to customize, options (if you really want to meddle)* ordering pods* separate milk frother.Summary;This is an absolute keeper. Meets all my needs, is affordable, doesn't require a massive cleanup every time you make an espresso and delivers consistent delicious coffee. Worth waiting for![...]Read more33 comments|

      Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome.ByDr. Jon March 1, 2014Color: BlackI have used this machine for about a week, and it is awesome!  I had used an espresso machine frequently years ago, but got sick of the grinding, prepping, priming, etc., especially before work in the morning.  So, I eventually gave up and bought a plain-ole coffee maker.  Unfortunately, "regular" coffee, to me, tastes like hot water.  I even tried a Kuerig, but returned it within a month - it was more convenient, but the coffees are no higher quality than any grocery-store brand coffee.  So I debated for a long time about whether I should wait for one of these brand-new Nespresso Vertuoline machines, or just buy one of the older, espresso-only Nespresso machines.I have to say that I'm very happy that I waited for this one!  The espresso is excellent, the drinks have all been hot (even when adding milk from the Aeroccino), the whole spinning process takes about 15 seconds (or less) to pour into the cup, and - most surprisingly - the new coffee-sized cartridges are AWESOME!  They taste NOTHING like regular, ground grocery-store coffee-in-a-can.  They are much more flavorful, much stronger, and seem fresher even than using whole coffee with a grinder (maybe it's from being sealed in the aluminum cartridges?).The Nespresso club has been great - they ship coffee and espresso cartridges within two days, and seem to have excellent customer service.  I emailed a question to them and had a personal answer (not a canned answer) within about 3 hours.My final comment - I have tried Keurig coffee in the past, and now have this Vertuoline; the Keurig wins on availability, but if you want a single-serve coffee maker, and actually appreciate and LIKE THE TASTE of good coffee, then this machine wins HANDS DOWN.EDIT 3/4/2014: Just wanted to add, based on another reviewer's inaccurate comments, that you CAN adjust the volume of the pour to between 0.3oz. and 17oz. by a simple process that is clearly explained in the owner's manual.  The machine remembers your programmed espresso levels and coffee levels separately, and keeps that programming until you reset it.Read more66 comments|
