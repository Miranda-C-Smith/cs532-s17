Cemma_jah - FOR SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN + TELL ME IS NOT TRUE






Monday, February 06, 2017























In relation to the recent national call for a Good governance by the leadership of Nigerian which is been propelled by Music Icon 2Baba calling for a  nationwide protest,



Nigeria's foremost  reggae artiste CEMMA JAH  decides to lend his voice to this current situation as a key stakeholder in the Nigerian music scene, as he express his feelings in these exceptional reggae songs titled  "Tell Me Its Not True" and "For sake of our children". 



Just as the poor masses have  demanded answers to current economic situation in the country, the "Lord have mercy", "Am missing u" and "African Lady" crooner has come up with this mind blowing songs produced by one of 

Nigeria's finest producers, MENUZZY  of Hit Biz Afrika.



 In support of the proposed  #IStandWithNigeria, I suggest you join the trend and share your feelings on Twitter with these hashtag:-  #cemmajahIStandWithNigeria and follow  @cemma_jah
