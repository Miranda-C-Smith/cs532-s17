January 20, 2017 gentlemenradio HOME, MUSIC POST


Skyty Nero slide through with this single ” Blackstars AFCON 2015 Documentary “. The rapper gave us in-depth report of 2015 Africa cup of nations and issues at Ghana black stars camp. Skyty Nero composed the song, using humorous lyrics to create a sense of what happen.
Ghanaian’s might have moved on from issues about Black stars two years ago but the scares of the heart broken is still alive.  Once again Nero has shown us how good he is when it comes to creativity. More interesting the kind of concept he deals with in his songs. Download and listen to the song below.
