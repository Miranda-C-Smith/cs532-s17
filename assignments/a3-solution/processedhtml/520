Experienced Child Care Social Workers (Levels 2 or 3) required by the South Area Team, located in the Weymouth & Portland area of Dorset. Weymouth & Portland is a beautiful Dorset coastal town which combines wonderful sandy beaches with the magnificence of the Jurassic Coast.
The South Area Teams provide assessment, planning and intervention in respect of referrals processed via the single point of contact (the pre-cursor to our MASH). Our involvement ranges from children in need to children in need of protection and intervention when children initially become looked after.
Social Workers are supervised and managed by a Team Manager who is responsible for a total of 5 Social Workers within the Team.
If you are considering a move we offer a VERY GENEROUS RELOCATION PACKAGE of up to £8,000 in approved cases.         
Interview Date: 7th March 2017
