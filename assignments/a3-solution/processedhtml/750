I received this in the mail today to test and give my thoughts & wow is this idea genius! I've been waiting for something like this, I'm always out & about so this is wonderful for a quick shave or touch ups before a party or gathering. I love that you only need buy the actual device once and then when needed you only need to buy the replacement pack which contains 2 blades and a shave bar. Only flaw is that at first it's a little hard to turn the dial to switch from let's say the shave bar to the blade, once you do it a few times you get used to it and it's no longer an issue though. LOVE it & it's pretty purple color!

This razor was nice and efficient but its really hard to turn the dial. Smart and innovative way to put shave, moisture and spray all in one. The water container was smaller than expected, but I suppose that its okay becuase this product is meant for touchups.

This is the first product that I have received from Swaggable.  I was not sure if I would like the product, but am happy to say that I do.  It is compact and functional, which are great features.  It is a great travel item since it would keep you from packing separate items in your luggage.  I would not be worried about anything exploding or leaking in your luggage all over your clothes like ocassionally happens with packed shaving gels.  The only issues that I have so far is the size of the water container, and that it is sometimes difficult to turn the dial.  I will definitely be using this for my upcoming travel.



Things I like:

great for travelcompactstyle of product 


Need to improve:

water container is a little smaller than I would likedial is a little difficult to turn at times

This product is amazing, I went to a wedding party yesterday and noticed I missed a spot shaving and of course I was carrying the sphynx in my bag cause it's portable and I just quickly sprayed the spot put soap on it and shaved it off and I didn't even need to leave the table to do it.  And people thought I was just scratching my leg. 



Things I like:

Portable and has everything you need for shaving the spots you missed.  Water soap and 2 razors

This is a must have when you are on the go. This is definetly going to go in my purse and stay with me. I love having a razor with me but I really really love the bar. I can not say enough about this product.
