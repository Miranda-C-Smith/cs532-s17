2016








 
Stylish Designs
The Oxy-Gen Air Dispenser is compact, stylish, contemporary and available in a choice of colours.  The VIVA!E Air Freshness unit will compliment any room - from luxurious lounges to high traffic washrooms.

Consistent & Continuous Fragrancing
VIVA!E Air Freshening system uses patented Ox-Gen Powered Technology to deliver consistent and continuous levels of fragrance and odour control for the full 60 day life of each refill, creating a permanently fresh environment that has a fresh impact every time you walk into the room.
Eco-Friendly System

 
VIVA!E is the only air freshener in the world that is Carbon Footprint approved.

In an independent process, it has been assessed and verified for emissions and energy consumption and was found to have significantly lower footprint compared to aerosol products  in the market. There are no harmful emissions, solvents or propellants and the reful is 100% recyclable and safe to dispose of in your regular plastic recycling waste. VIVA!E can reduce the amount of VOCs being emitted by up to 90% when compared to aerosol cans. 
Eliminate Bad Odours
The VIVA!E Air Freshness System uses NutraLox, a propietary odour nutralising agent to eliminate, not mask, any bad odours, leaving only fresh scent in the air. Nutra-Lox effectively eliminates bad odours such as tobacco, kitchen odours, sweat, mildew, animal and body odours.

 
 
 
Hassle Free Operation
The Oxy-Gen VIVA!E uses a simple load and go system. VIVA!E operates silently and works against gravity so the fragrance oil will not pool or leak. The air care system is supplied with 2 AA alkaline batteries which last up to two years. Each dispenser covers a volume up to 300 cubic feet or 75 cubic meters.
Top Quality Fragrances
Pure modern fragrance oils that customers, tenants and visitors will notice and love.  The fragrances are available in a wide range across Marine, Floral, Citrus, Fruity, Designer & Oriental scents.
