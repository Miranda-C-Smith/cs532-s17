By law, the ingredients included in a package of pet food need to be declared in decreasing order of weight. Since meat tends to have considerable moisture content, it usually appears at the top of the list on any package that contains moist pet food. A package of dry cat food with the same ingredients as a package of moist cat food would need to list its ingredients in a different order. When you compare two different brands, you need to keep in mind whether they are both foods in the same category – moist or dry.">
