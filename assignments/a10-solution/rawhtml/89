												<p>Have you been hearing the term “<a href="http://www.whatdoesotpmean.com/">OTP</a>” now and then? Wondering <strong>what does OTP mean</strong>? Well, Internet does that to you. We are a generation who are addicted to the slang more than the grammar and therefore the result is the usage of the terms like this. Now, what does this OTP stand for? One Time Password? Maybe.  It is an acronym for this as well, but however the slang doesn’t say that. According to the internet, OTP is an acronym used as a linguistic shortcut for a fictional thing. Many of us who watch TV shows or Sitcoms, who read books, are already familiar with the term, but not all of us are hip and used to it. Therefore, to help you keep up with the pace of the changing landscape of verbal language, here in this article, we are going to the <strong>OTP meaning. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean3.jpg?resize=350%2C269" alt="what does otp mean,otp meaning,what does otp stand for,otp definition" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean3.jpg?w=350 350w, http://i0.wp.com/whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean3.jpg?resize=300%2C231 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you are a part of a fandom, you already know how important the word OTP is to everyone who is in the fandom. If you are not let me tell you that OTP as it stands is an aesthetic element that describes the emotions of the fandom in one word. However, it&#8217;s not entirely necessary for you to know what OTP is even when you&#8217;re a big fan of a fandom. For example, my mom has been a huge fan of Doctor Who for a long time now that she often takes references when I&#8217;m in the bad mood to cheer up. She&#8217;s an English teacher and therefore, has read all parts of Lord of Rings and Harry Potter. But, whenever I take the term &#8220;OTP&#8221; she gives me this, &#8220;WTF is wrong with you kid&#8221; look, and that makes me realize how unfamiliar she&#8217;s with the term. Despite being a fan, why doesn&#8217;t she know OTP is?, I wondered. And then my observations told me something and here is what I yielded from them.</p>

<h2><strong>What does OTP Stand for?| What does OTP mean ?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-2.png?resize=476%2C467" alt="what does otp mean,otp meaning,what does otp stand for,otp definition" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-2.png?w=476 476w, http://i1.wp.com/whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-2.png?resize=300%2C294 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Coming to the full form of OTP, it stands for the term &#8220;One True Pairing&#8221;. What is this One True Pairing now? It is a word or a phrase invented in the fandoms to describe their favorite couple/couples. Though the word says one, it&#8217;s not mandatory for you to restrict yourself to a single couple. You can always ship more than one pairing. The interesting about OTP is that you make your couple, I mean the couple that is not a pairing in the show or the book you are reading. Usually, the number One is added because every fandom member will ultimately ship a single couple even when they like the other couples more. Extracted from OTP, TTP stands for Two True Pairings.</p>
<p>This is when you&#8217;re not entirely sure about your pairing and might want a multiple choice of shipping. TTP is when a single person of the couple is replaced by another couple, this means there is a third person involved in the romantic relationship. It&#8217;s more like a threesome, where unlike threesome the consistent one is paired with either of the alternatives at once, but not at the same time. For example, if you have watched Vampire Diaries, Damon-Elena-Stefan are TTP while Niklaus-Caroline is OTP. OTPS are not always generic romantic relationships. Sometimes, they can also be BroTP, which stands for Bromance between two males, a non-romantic (Friend kind of) OTP or other parodic elements. By Parodic Elements, I mean Joey and his food.</p>
<h3><em><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What OTP Really Means ?</strong></span></em></h3>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-1.png?resize=500%2C134" alt="what does otp mean,otp meaning,what does otp stand for,otp definition" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-1.png?w=500 500w, http://i2.wp.com/whatdoesotpmean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/what-does-otp-mean-1.png?resize=300%2C80 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>People who have an OTP or two may compose and/or read fanfiction about those couples, however necessarily. In any case concerning whether you&#8217;re into fanfic, however, the one characterizing highlight the total of what OTPs have is this: We get mind boggling candidly put resources into them. As an insatiable follower who frequently doesn&#8217;t need my most loved books to end, I know those feels. OTP is more than just shipping. OTP is an emotion. There are days when I was so low only to come to room, open by laptop and read a Fanfic and suddenly the entire world gets better. This is how attached and how obsessed we are with OTPs.</p>
<p>So where does the term originate from? As indicated by Know Your Meme, the earliest known use of OTP happened on LiveJournal in October 2002. The term appeared in reference to potential pairings of NSYNC individuals: Betty Plotnik Wrote in LiveJournal, &#8220;Joey/Lance: In some ways, this is my OTP, if by &#8220;genuine&#8221; we&#8217;re discussing what I truly believe is authoritatively conceivable.&#8221; Given the way the term is just calmly dropped in here, however, I think it might originate before this specific post. In any occasion, the acronym was initially characterized later on Urban Dictionary in September of 2003 — a definition which is tragically filled with spelling blunders, yet which pretty unmistakably portrays what the term means and how to utilize it:</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><em>OTP definition </em></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>&#8220;OTP: One True Pairing. Used as a part of fandoms to express  what characters [sic] you adore (set up together romanticly).&#8221; </em></strong></p>
<p>The fun reality, incidentally: Fan fiction and delivery as practices are old. Like, really old. I&#8217;m not simply talking a couple of decades; I mean roughly a century. Know Your Meme reports that, in 1913, a book called Old Friends, New Fancies was distributed, which fundamentally made a fresh out of the box new hybrid story including characters from three notable Jane Austen books: Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, and Northanger Abbey. Think of it as Kindle Unlimited for the pre-advanced age. Fascinating, no? It makes you think about whether there are different case out there that are even more seasoned.  Therefore, even though the usage of OTP has become quite extinct now, we still adore the term and use it when we are on tantrums of throwing our emotions towards a couple. For example, Dramoine (Draco and Hermoine) of Harry Potter is my OTP, because I usually ship hate love relationships than the usual love-love ones.</p>
<p>Facebook rivals Tumblr and Twitter as one of the top informal organizations on the web. A &#8220;microblogging&#8221; stage along with the social media network, Facebook is home to craftsmen, authors, trendy people, and geeks of numerous kinds, however above all, it&#8217;s home to numerous, numerous fangirls.

<h2><em><strong>What does OTP mean on Facebook?</strong></em></h2>
<p>OTP remains for &#8220;One True Pairing.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a term that is utilized on Facebook a considerable measure by users who need to depict two people, especially in a fandom or work of fiction, who they think would make an extraordinary couple.  A few clients like to tell the group who they think their OTP may be. Different times, they&#8217;ll call attention to an understood anecdotal character or big name and match them up with another character or celebrity as their OTP. Therefore, an OTP can not always be a romantic relationship between two people but also can stand for relationship between friends, relationship between brothers, relationship between two people whom we like to ship together in an authentic way be it romantic or non-romantic.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that OTP is a term for the most part utilized as a part of growing fandom culture, some find that it&#8217;s gradually crawling it&#8217;s way into other non-fandom related discussions and informal communication locales, similar to Twitter.</p>

<p>One true pairing is only a method for saying like the couple&#8217;s intended to be, it&#8217;s The couple. The two individuals on the planet that are perfect partners without a doubt. Apparently it&#8217;s utilized more freely than that however that is the general thought. there&#8217;s no genuine reason it&#8217;s called that, just got promoted through book and show geeks and nerds I&#8217;m almost certain. The OTP, or One True Pairing, is extremely precarious thing to qualify. Is it accurate to say that this is thinking about standard connections? The fanbase around a particular matching in fanon? For effortlessness&#8217; purpose, I&#8217;m gonna.look at pairings from right now well known activity, and in my perspective, IchiRuki( Rukia and Ichigo, from Bleach) must be the complete OTP. It has the longest history amongst contemporary pairings, and has one of the biggest and most vocal fanbases of every one of them. You characterize your fan experience. Nobody else. Not just would you be able to have an OTP per fandom, you can have more than one OTP IN a fandom. There are some I have an OTP and an OT3.</p>
<p>Some place I have an OTP and after that this no doubt, possibly second OTP. While there are some implicit standards for how you manage different individuals from a fandom, keeping in mind every fandom has its own peculiar traditions, just you get the opportunity to choose how you fan. Also, on the off chance that you need an entire stable of OTPs? That is your business. How you interface with the arrangement and fandoms you adore is entirely up to you. Love or abhor character if that is the thing that feels right to you. (only don&#8217;t accuse the performers for the defects of their characters) Ship whoever you need. Each fan experience is entirely exceptional. You bring your own particular contemplations, thoughts, assessments, history, and encounters to each book you read, television scene you watch, or other fan experience you join in. Nobody ought to ever attempt to let you know how you ought to feel about something. You need to do that for yourself. Your OTP(s) are dependent upon you to choose. You like two individuals together a ton, OTP. You like two unique individuals from that first OTP together, OTP.</p>
<p>You like two other people, OTP. There is nobody who can set the guidelines for this. You can have all the OTPs on the, planet and that is alright. Oh my goodness a smidgen about my OTPs. I have heaps of OTPs. I have OTPs in every single diverse fandom. I have more than one OTP in a few fandoms. I have an order of my OTPs with a sub-chain of command. In one fandom, I have four OTPs that are all involved the same two characters. Presently, in the event that I can do it, so would you be able to. Go forward and spread the affection for all your OTPs (and may they be various and brimming with feels). Back in the times of Mono-Fandom fans, the term OTP implied the primary blending that the fan was keen on, period. There wasn&#8217;t even a second fandom, not to mention a second matching inside the fandom, that was incorporated as a significant aspect of the definition.</p>

<p>One of the primary employments of the term was in 1984 from an outline from the distributer of zine Alternatives #2, &#8220;This zine has something for everybody&#8230;The stories are for the most part Spock-driven, so on the off chance that you adore an accurate Vulcan, this present ones for you!&#8230;And kid, does he get around &#8211; we have Kirk/Spock, Spock/McCoy, Spock/Chapel, Spock/and different others, including True Pairing&#8230;And obviously, more Kirk/Spock, since we as a whole realize that is our one genuine pairing!!!&#8230;Variety is the flavor of life &#8211; and this zine is to a great degree fiery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another first say was in 2002 in Discovered in a Letterbox #23 in which a fan remarked on whether Daniel (in Stargate SG-1) could be cut with anybody other than Jack: &#8220;&#8230; I figure that could be connected to any fandom and the possibility of OTP (one genuine blending).&#8221;  Somebody with an OTP may have practically zero enthusiasm for perusing or making fanworks for different pairings, in spite of the fact that they may at present be keen on perusing/delivering gen. Fans who do read or make fanworks for different pairings in a solitary fandom could have an OTP; on the off chance that they do, they may portray their most loved blending as their OTP. The inverse of an OTP is an NOTP.</p>

Ordinance and rationale don&#8217;t inexorably apply, and hybrid OTPs are not remarkable. But, yes on a whole OTPs are very crucial for a fan who is a part of a bigger Fandom. <strong>What does OTP mean in text language?</strong> The degrees to which this is taken differs fiercely.

<p>Whether because they&#8217;re super cute and intended-to-be or in light of the fact that their makers are keeping them separated just to torment you, you infrequently can&#8217;t resist the urge to feel exceptional feelings when taking a look at your OTPs.  There are a couple of terms we&#8217;ll have to characterize before getting further into this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Ship</em></strong> &#8211; Derived from the word relationship. This term can be utilized as a verb or a thing to couple two anecdotal or non-anecdotal individuals.</li>
<li><strong><em>OTP or One True Pairing </em></strong>&#8211; This is the mix of two people who you solidly accept ought to be as one. You select a single ship (or various ships) and hold those most importantly others; they are your OTPs.</li>
<li><strong><em>Fangirling </em></strong>&#8211; the demonstration of spazzing out over something or somebody you are extremely enthusiastic about.</li>
<li><strong><em>Feels</em></strong> &#8211; when serious feelings assume control over your extremely being and you can&#8217;t deal with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>OTP shipping wars were second just to Subbing versus Dubbing for warmth and brutality. The level of zeal showed for a particular OTP might be about their separation from the Official Couple and/or the Word Of God for the work being referred to.  Now and again, holding their favored characters to totally various measures than the precise matching is a great characteristic of OTP shippers. On the off chance that somebody contends that you have to demonstrate that X and Y inspired wedded to demonstrate they&#8217;re enamored, and the rings on their fingers don&#8217;t match, however, they realize that X and Z adore each other given &#8216;chemistry,&#8217; they&#8217;re certainly protecting their OTP.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, workable for a man to have numerous OTPs, recently with no cover between them. A few people allude to their most loved trio ship by the comparative term One True Threesome, or OT 3. On the other hand indeed, &#8220;OT&#8221; annexed with any number on the off chance that they&#8217;re much more driven by people involved. BroTP is utilized as a term for non-sentimental OTPs, of the &#8220;these individuals are closest companions, and nobody will let me know generally&#8221; assortment (for example, John and Sherlock of Sherlock BBC). Male/female and female/female BroTPs are some of the time likewise called FrOTPs.</p>

<p>Frequently the expression &#8220;OTP&#8221; is utilized wryly as a part of a spoof of transportation, particularly on the off chance that it includes an offbeat blending, (for example, the ever-prominent HousexForeman OTP), or a character and their most loved (&#8220;HousexCameron&#8221;), and so forth and so forth. Everybody has their favorite couples and OTPs. We may call it distinctive terms like &#8220;dream couple&#8221; or &#8220;love group,&#8221; yet the nuts and bolts of being a fangirl are healthy learning: you see them, you understand they&#8217;d be awesome together, you express your commitment for this matching, you surrender your spirit in some unholy give up to attempt and get it going. Try not to seek to try to deny it; there is a fangirl in all of us simply sitting tight for the best possible measure of learns about to come spazzing of covering up. We&#8217;re the same. Here are our most important 5 OTPs and why we adore them.</p>

<p>Presently we should investigate a couple of cases. Since I feel fairly uncomfortable dispatching genuine individuals the cases I&#8217;ll give here are all drawn from fiction. I don&#8217;t think about you, yet I&#8217;d feel truly peculiar watching a couple story highlighting myself as a genuine match matched up with somebody I most likely have no enthusiasm for dating. That happened with Howard Roark of Fountain Head.</p>
<p>That being said, here are my favorite 5 OTPS of all time.</p>
<h3>5 OTPS of All Time</h3>
<ol>
<li>Neville and Luna</li>
<li>Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen</li>
<li>Sherlock Holmes and John Watson</li>
<li>Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.</li>
<li>Harvey Specter and Mike Ross.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though most of the above (three) are BroTPs that&#8217;s because they have this unique thing about them that makes me ship, scream and cry my heart out for them. In case if you have an OTP like this, comment in the section and promote their love! ,We hope that now you all know the answer of &#8221; what does OTP mean in texting&#8221;.</p>
<p>For understanding this we first need to understand, <strong>what does OTP mean</strong>? Well, OTP in this context stands for “One Time Password”. OTP is a unique alpha-numeric 6-digit code that is generated automatically for a particular transaction or session. Once an OTP is used it cannot be used again so it provides a better security.</p>
<p>Now, talking about <strong>what does OTP mean in banking</strong>? In banking OTP is generally used while making an online transaction or while logging in your account. When making an online transaction after entering your card details and pin, another window pops out which asks for an OTP which is send to your registered mobile number. Once you enter to the OTP the transaction is then completed. If you have changed your mobile number that you have registered in the bank then you can change the mobile number for getting the OTP by taking the question challenge or by calling the BDO Customer Centre and asking them to update your new contact number. Once the number is updated you will get the OTP on your next login to your updated number. Then after entering the OTP you can continue with your transactions.</p>

<h2><strong>Achieving Security and Benefits of OTP in Banking<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Since we have covered <strong>what does OTP mean in banking</strong>. Now let’s talk about the <strong>benefits of OTP</strong>. Think if someone has your user ID and password how easy it is for him/her to access your account if we are using the static (traditional) password that is created by the user. But in case of OTP even after having your ID and password the login is incomplete because the OTP will be send to your registered mobile number. Now talking about achieving security. A number of ways also integrate two factor authentication that is along with authenticated login the OTP is added to provide a double layer security. So that if any one of them is incorrect then the login would be incomplete.</p>
<h2><strong>Advantages of OTP in Banking<br />
</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The OTP’s that are generated expires in a given time period depending on the tokens configuration. If the token is used after that time period then it won’t work.</li>
<li>The OTP’s that are generated are different for every login. Once an OTP is used it cannot be reused.</li>
<li>The static password that are created by us are not vulnerable to the attacks but the OTP’s are. If someone gets their hand on the old OTP it won’t be of any use to them.</li>
<li>Moreover, anyone who uses similar password for different systems can be easily attacked if anyone gets hand on their password. But with OTP even after getting his/her password it won’t be possible to open the account.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OTP’s are generated using mathematic algorithms which uses the concept of random numbers or randomness that is the number that is generated is not in a fixed pattern so it becomes difficult for the attacker to think for the next OTP by seeing the previous one. Even hash functions are used to derive the value of OTP as they it is difficult to reverse them so it becomes hard to find the value that was used for that hash.</p>
