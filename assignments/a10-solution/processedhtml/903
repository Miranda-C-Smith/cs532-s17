			XYLØ – Get Closer (SHADES Remix)			
		
February 6, 2017






Thomas Matera and Julien Johnson make up the New York City-based DJ/Producer duo Shades, who are coming in hot with their latest remix of XYLØ’s hit song Get Closer. It’s been a treat to listen to these two college students develop their craft. Their remix catalogue most notably includes a progressive spin on the All American Rejects’ single Move Along and XY&O’s Fahrenheit. But it’s this Get Closer remix that provides us with what I believe to be Shades’ most unique and cohesive sound to date. Shades keeps the foundation of the song together while adding their own spin, giving us a remix that flows to an uptempo beat. We can’t wait to see what these guys do next.
