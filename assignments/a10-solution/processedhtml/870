Just the right amount of raspberries, enhanced by lemon zest, and topped with that yummy cream cheese frosting‚Ä¶ I brought these to a girls‚Äô brunch last weekend.

Plenty of mimosas (hold the orange juice), bacon, sausage, a quiche, fruit, an amazing buttermilk bundt, mini lemon meringue pies, and these raspberry sweet rolls.Obviously, with that kind of spread ‚Äì a good time was had by all!

Perfect for breakfast or brunch or Tuesday afternoons, these pretty little rolls will delight everyone!     Prep Time 2 hours       Cook Time 15 minutes    Total Time 2 hours 15 minutes     Servings 1 dozen rollsIngredientsDough 1 cup warm milk 110 degrees F/45 degrees C 2 eggs room temperature 1/3 cup butter melted 4 1/2 cups bread flour 1 tsp salt 1/2 cup white sugar 2 1/2 tsp bread machine yeastFilling 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup brown sugar 3 cups frozen raspberries 1/2 cup sugar 2 tsp cornstarch 1 tsp lemon zestFrosting 3 oz cream cheese softened 1/4 cup butter softened 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tsp lemon zest 1/8 tsp salt 1 Tbs milk 1 Tbs lemon juice optionalDirectionsPlace dough ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.After the dough cycle is done, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes - this is an important step, don't skip!FillingCombine the raspberries, sugar, and lemon zest.AssemblyRoll dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle.Spread dough with butter and sprinkle evenly with brown sugar, then the raspberry mixture.Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. I use (plain, unflavoured) dental floss to do this.Place a piece of dental floss under the rolled dough, 1 inch from the end. Bring the flossup around the dough and cross it over the top, cutting through the dough and filling. Repeat at 1-inch intervals.Place rolls in 2 lightly greased deep dish pie pans (or use a 9x13 pan). Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 400 degrees FBake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, butter, confectioners' sugar, zest, salt and milk (and lemon juice, if using)Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.Stand Mixer/Dough Hook instructions:Combine milk and sugar in a bowl, and put in microwave until the temp is reached (it's supposed to be lukewarm, not hot).Sprinkle yeast over the surface, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.(Tiny bubbles should begin to appear on the surface or around the edge of the container and it should start to smell yeasty).Add the yeast mixture to the bowl of your stand mixer with the dough hook attached.Add the flour, salt, eggs and butter and knead for 8-10 minutes. It should form a ball, and be relatively smooth.Let sit in a warm place, until doubled in size (about an hour?). Punch down - follow from Step 2 above)Source: Dough¬†and frosting ‚Äì Kylee Cooks, Filling from¬†www.twopeasandtheirpod.com ¬† Check out what others in the group made this month!Anadama Rolls from Passion KneadedBulochki (Russian Sweet Yeast Rolls) from Mayuri‚Äôs JikoniCinnamon Rolls from BakingyummiesCrescent Rolls from Sara‚Äôs Tasty BudsFeta Olive Knots from Food Lust People LoveFlax Oat Wheat Dinner Rolls from Cook‚Äôs HideoutEinkorn Parmesan and Garlic Rolls from The Wimpy VegetarianGluten Free Cinnamon Rolls from A Baker‚Äôs HouseHokkaido Milk Rolls from Baking in PyjamasKahvalti ‚Äì Turkish-style Breakfast Buns from A Shaggy Dough StoryMasala Bread Rolls from Sneha‚Äôs RecipesMini Cheddar Bialys from Karen‚Äôs Kitchen StoriesOatmeal Dinner Rolls from A Day in the Life on the FarmPesto Rolls from Veg NationSavory Cheddar Rolls from Magnolia DaysStuffed Vegatable Masala Buns from Spill the SpicesTwisted Knotted Mint Garlic Rolls  from Gayathri‚Äôs Cook SpotWholewheat Low Fat Stuffed Cinnamon Rolls from Sizzling Tastebuds #BreadBakers is a group of bread loving bakers who get together once a month to bake bread with a common ingredient or theme.
