Designed by Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz, the Keep x Ad-Rock Ramos is a new take on our classic midtop.  Inspired to make a sneaker that would keep him warm during the winter months, the Keep x Ad-Rock Ramos features a water-resistant, nylon cordura body and is lined with synthetic shearling.  The ankle features a channel quilted, silicon coated nylon accent, stuffed with synthetic down.  The D-ring and bungee lace structure makes for easy slipping on and off, and both black and magenta laces are included.  To finish, each pair features embroidery of Adam's name, split between left and the right shoes.  Net proceeds of the shoe will benefit Planned Parenthood.  As always, all of our shoes are cruelty-free and consciously produced in factories audited by international, third parties who monitor ethical working conditions.  “I collaborated with Keep shoes not just because I wanted warm sneaks, but because I support small business. I support women run business. I support Asian-American run business. Net proceeds of this shoe will be donated to Planned Parenthood because I support a woman’s right to choose and feel that women should not be punished for making decisions about their own lives and bodies. If you have similar beliefs, you might wanna grab a pair. Or, if you simply support fresh styles, then you too can be part of what peeps in Keeps are doing.”  -- Adam Horovitz
