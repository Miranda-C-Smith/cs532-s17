College Station, Texas (KBTX) -- The Texas A&M; women's basketball team had to dig deep against Auburn on Sunday to extend their Reed Arena winning streak to 7 games following a 66-61 win.



One of the big keys to the rally was how guard Danni Williams was able to put a tough first half of shooting behind her and get in a groove in the 20 minutes.
Williams only had 8 points at the break, but finished with a game high 25. Danni was a perfect 3 for 3 from behind the arc in the 2nd half with one beating the 3rd quarter buzzer.
Williams says the team's faith in her shooting keeps her from getting down when her shots aren't falling. 
"I haven't shot very well in several games and even this game I didn't start off shooting very well, but my teammates believe in me so much and Curtyce is in my ear, 'keep shooting don't let that affect you. That really helps my confidence knowing I have their trust," said Williams.
Williams and the Aggies will close out their 3 game home stand Thursday night against Alabama. Tip off is set for 7pm at Reed Arena
