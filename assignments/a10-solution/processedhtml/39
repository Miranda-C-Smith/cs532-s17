What is BentBox?

BentBox is an ecommerce platform designed for the sale of photos, videos and files in general.
BentBox is specifically designed for photographers, videographers and content creators.

With BentBox you can upload without limits and you decide the price for your work


Your photos and videos are uploaded into Boxes of content. You decide the price and licensing agreement for your Boxes and publish them for sale.
Your BentBox personal page becomes your online digital shop that you can share on your other websites to direct your audience to your work for sale.
When a Box is sold you receive 100% of your asking price. We put a commission on top of your price. The commission is paid by the buyer.
It's 100% free to use as your online digital shop.
