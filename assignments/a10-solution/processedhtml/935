Tap Tap Fish: READ THIS--Such a good game!!!

    If you haven't gotten Tap Tap Fish yet, you're really missing out. Before we continue: this game won the Best of 2016 App Store award, meaning it's really good. To the the creator: thanks so much for making this game! It's so calming. There is no stress over winning battles, protecting your aquarium from attack, and other things you would find in most other games. And getting the "currency", if you will, to grow your aquarium, is so easy! All you have to do is, well, Tap! You can still get upgrades with crystals, or even buy them, but if you don't want to, the game is still just as enjoyable. The graphics are gorgeous. Rich colors and minimalistic yet beautiful style really enhance game quality. There is such a variety of fish and corals, literally hundreds, and other things to add to your cute Little Rock. Updates are quite frequent, making sure that your game is always fast and efficient. There are even limited-time events for each season, such as Spring/Easter, Valentines, Christmas, etc. There are limitless amounts of approaches to the game, and you can share your achievements and photos with your friends :) This game is definitely NOT a waste of space, and you can come back to it every day, and leave feeling much more calm. There is so much more to this game than can be expressed in words. If you're considering getting Tap Tap Fish, definitely get it. You won't regret it. 🐠🦐🐋🐡🦑🐙🐬
  



Addictive--until you pass a certain point

    As simple as the game is, you'd be surprised to find how addictive it is. It's fun trying to get as many species as possible, grow corals, and ultimately build your own reef. I really really liked it until I started passing my max aquarium limit. Once you reach around Z vitality getting fish is a lot easier, but the problem is the plants now take FOREVER to unlock because their prices/requirements are so spaced out, making it really irritating to try to expand your tank (because the max amount of fish you can have out swimming is based on the plants/corals). Personally I think an addition of plants (that don't take forever to unlock), more reef fish species, and an expansion in the games explorable area would be good (which there's a tab that looks something like that may be coming in a future update). I'd also think it'd be cool to see the correlate keep growing (it does it like three times before it's territory stops expanding), and maybe even grow some smaller correlate bubble tops around the reef. And please for the love of fish make more plants grow at the back of the correlate. There's like a thousand plants at its front and it's back is almost entirely bare...Other than that, it's a good game. I'd just love to see it expand more.
  



Best Tapper game out there

    This game is very unique and fun. There is lots of fish and coral, and even events. The events are really fun, so please do more of them. The downsides of this game though is that 1. The N-S vitality wall, when I was at this point it took me about a week to pass it, and I play this game a lot? 2. The size of the giant and colossal squid. They don't have Giant and Colossal in the name for no reason, in real life the giant squid is about 20 feet long, but in the game it isn't even longer than the oarfish. And finally #3 after playing this game for a while I have realized that the chests and the Gifts of the ocean, angle, or god give you almost nothing compared to what you can get from doing your skills once or twice. Also a great fix for the game is fish balances... I don't think a clownfish should cost as much as a blue whale, so maybe you can unlock the fish and depending the requirements to unlock the fish depends on the cost of the fish. For example if you unlock the clownfish it could start at 3,000A vitality and the more you buy, the more it increases, and maybe the blue whale could be like 350,000W vitality. I think that's how it should work, but hey, I love the game either way, so please consider these changes... Thanks!
