            They’re going from ‘Gone Girl’ to the Boston Marathon bombing movie

Trent Reznor has long since jumped into the movie music game: He was behind the unsettling score of 2010’s The Social Network, and collaborated with producer and composer Atticus Ross to provide the music for Gone Girl and Leonardo DiCaprio’s upcoming climate change documentary, Before the Flood.
Now, he and Ross have signed up for another ambitious project: They’re helming the score for Patriots Day, the drama based on the events of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that features Mark Wahlberg as its star and producer.
The director, Peter Berg — who’s also the director of Deepwater Horizon, which also stars Wahlberg and is currently in theaters — is thrilled about their involvement and said so on Instagram.
Given Reznor’s film portfolio, he’s a sensible fit for Patriots Day: The Social Network, Gone Girl, and even Before the Flood all deal with difficult themes, be they the crippling pressures of genius and ambition, murderous plots and betrayals, or devastating truths we can’t ignore. A grisly, action-packed crime story anchored on a terrorist act like Patriots Day could potentially touch on any or all of those, and the Nine Inch Nails frontman can conduct that tension into music like none other.
Patriots Day is set to hit theaters in Boston, Los Angeles, and New York on December 21 before its wide release on January 13, 2017.
