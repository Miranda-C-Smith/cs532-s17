Update: February 5 2017: We’ve just learned that Amazon employees are piling pressure on the company to immediately ditch Breitbart — and the company is feeling the heat. Amazon’s ad team has had to clarify that it is looking into a “longer term solution to use a 3rd party brand safety which may block amazon ads from showing up on certain pages on sites like Breitbart in the future.” Our pressure is working. Let’s work together with Amazon employees and make sure Amazon ditches Breitbart. Update: January 27 2017: Breitbart's advertisers are dropping like flies. In the last 24 hours alone, three corporations and three universities agreed to drop the extreme far right website thanks to our pressure. This is the perfect moment to double down on Amazon and convince it that Breitbart's brand of bigotry is bad for business.Breitbart News, the extreme far right website that helped elect Donald Trump, is trying to fast-track a global expansion, starting with France, Germany and Italy in time for key elections in early 2017.But Breitbart can only go ahead with its global expansion if it has the money to do it.Here's where we come in: People power has already forced BMW,  T-Mobile and Kelloggs and hundreds of other corporations to drop Breitbart — and now, we are going to force Amazon to follow suit.Amazon is receiving loads of pressure already, and if we add our voices from across the planet together now, we can make sure Amazon can't ignore us anymore. Tell Amazon: stop investing in hate. Pull your advertising from Breitbart.  Breitbart spits the most hateful stuff you’ve ever heard — everything from attacks on LGBTQ+ folks to claiming that contraception makes women "sluts”.And Breitbart's hatred may directly violate Amazon's own principles around acceptable advertising. Amazon's own policy: it will not tolerate "[c]ontent that is threatening, abusive, harassing, hateful, or that incites violence or intolerance, or that advocates or discriminates against a protected group, whether based on race, color, national origin, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age or other category."  A powerful grassroots campaign is gaining traction through social media and is pushing companies to pull advertising from Breitbart. And it’s working. Already over 1,750 companies have pulled out of Breitbart, and the list is growing by the day. And together, we can add Amazon to that list. SumOfUs members are fighting hatred and discrimination worldwide. With massive public pressure, we’re going to force corporations to take responsibility for how they advertise, and are going to keep fighting Breitbart’s global expansion.  Let's come together to make Amazon stop advertising with Breitbart, and show the world that people power trumps hate. Join us in demanding Amazon pull its advertising Breitbart.
