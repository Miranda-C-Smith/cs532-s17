WNRN In-Studio Sessions Presented By Blue Mountain Brewery  What Our Listeners are SayingWNRN is the first station on my dial and the only station that offers that ‘just’ right’ blend of artists I love and new music discoveries. Music news and local sponsors are also reasons I enjoy listening to NRN have been a faithful listener for the past 13 years.Nathan F., Charlottesville, VAWhen we moved to Cville six years ago, we didn’t really have strong community ties. About a year after our move, we started volunteering at the station, and it finally felt like we were home. Now five years later, some of our best local friends came from relationships built through NRN. Thanks for helping to make Charlottesville a true community for us!Kristy and Adam, Charlottesville, VAI love the mix of new and older music!! I moved to Harrisonburg a year ago from Maryland and there is nothing like WNRN there. I listen to it daily. It’s amazing to me that this station can bring so much musical joy to me!Karen S., Harrisonburg, VABest music radio station I’ve ever heard. Love the range of new music, the local commitment, and of course the giveaways! Thanks for keeping the spirit of good radio alive and for giving back to nonprofits with the community connection.Laura A., Fredericksburg, VAI was introduced to WNRN by my girlfriend, just as we first started dating. You could say we fell in love to many of the songs played on this station. She’s currently serving overseas but we can still listen to the online stream together. Thanks WNRN!Ben P., Milton, FLI want to take this opportunity to thank you, and everyone at WNRN, for the pleasure you bring every day, all day long, and the joy of discovering new artists, or new songs by old favorites.
