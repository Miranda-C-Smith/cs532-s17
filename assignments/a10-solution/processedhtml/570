                                            No one loves Coachella more than Vanessa Hudgens! The Powerless star, 28, has been named the “Queen of Coachella” by fans obsessed with her boho-chic ensembles at the annual music festival.

“They’re not outrageous. They’re bohemian,” Hudgens insisted to Ellen DeGeneres during Tuesday’s show. “I mean, like, that I couldn’t wear to the grocery store, which is why I love Coachella because it gives you an excuse to wear things you wouldn’t normally wear.”                                        










 

                                            In addition to her fashion opportunities, Hudgens is also excited to see the big names performing at this year’s show. While she “loves” Radiohead, the Disney alum is most looking forward to Beyonce. 
“I’m really stoked for all the headliners,” she said. “I’m excited to see how Beyonce’s going to perform with twins. I mean, she’ll kill it, because she’s Beyonce. So her, [I’m] very excited for that.”
Beyonce announced last week that she is pregnant with twins, but has not clarified what this will mean for the April festival.

One performance that is definitely on the lineup is Bey’s GRAMMY appearance. ET exclusively revealed that the pregnant “Formation” singer will return to the GRAMMY stage. She is nominated for nine GRAMMYs this year for her album, Lemonade.
