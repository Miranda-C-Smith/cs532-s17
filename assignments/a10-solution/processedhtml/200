When Grammy Award-winning musician Billy Childs was a young boy, his older sisters introduced him to the work of singer-songwriter Laura Nyro. Her blend of Broadway-inspired melodies, jazz improvisation and socially conscious lyrics captivated and inspired him. Childs returned to his early source of inspiration when he conceived and orchestrated his exquisite 2014 album Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro. The album featured a host of guest artists, including Renee Fleming, Esperanza Spalding, Yo-Yo Ma and more. Now, Childs brings the album's music to life in a live performance featuring Becca Stevens, Alicia Olatuja and Quartet SF at Herbst Theatre.
