Win A Dreadbox NYX Synth worth £549 With Red Dog Music
Posted by Linda on February 6, 2017  · 18 Comments  







For our February competition we’ve got a super special prize for you: the Dreadbox NYX, a new a 2 oscillator paraphonic analogue synth.

All Dreadbox synths and effects are handmade in Athens, Greece. The NYX can work standalone but also has 15 modular patch points so it can fit in to a modular set up as well. It also has unique built-in reverb effects by Crazy Tube Circuits. Hear them and the awesome analogue sounds in action in this demo:

Not only could you be one of the first UK owners, but you can also own it for FREE, because we’re giving one away at the end of the month. All you need to do to enter is sign up for our email list below, and after you’ve done that you can increase your chances of winning by completing other actions.
GOOD LUCK!

You’re not signed up for this competition yet, if you’d like to try entering just fill in the sign-up form on this blog post. Good luck!

Hi Linda, I’m having trouble completing the tweet on twitter entires. I have tweeted it (https://twitter.com/de_archive/status/829696816123883520) but everytime I click ‘already tweeted’ and enter my twitter handle it tells me to ‘complete action first’ what am I doing wrong?

Hi Etienne, your tweet entry hasn’t registered (the other entries have), I’m not sure what went wrong, but maybe try deleting your tweet and trying again using the ‘connect your twitter account’ button instead. Hope that works!

Hi Linda, 
Thanks. I figured it out – its becasue the tweet and link account buttons weren’t showing in Chrome. Just didi it in Safari & they showed up…
