It has an actual storyline that isn't all that important to follow but if you finish the tasks you get extra experience which equals level up which equals more energy to keep playing. Had a few issues with the 'Friend' aspect but it has been fixed. You can still play the game without having friends, although it does give you something to do while waiting on energy and to get more experience and help getting collections. Has in app purchases but completely playable without, the limited energy helps keep me from constantly playing it because I am addicted.                    Kate Spivak          I love how they claim that they've "fixed the friend list" (when it wasn't broken in the first place) and now - 4 days later - you STILL can only see your friend, but not interact with them. Changing my rating from a 3 to a 1 until they fix this.  Wondering if they ever thought about testing updates before releasing them?  If they weren't constantly adding annoying bugs to this game and  then taking days to weeks to fix them, I would probably rate this game a 5. I guess everyone loses.                    Deborah Gould          It's a gotta have app.  Down side is you can't transfer progress from one phone to the next so I'm starting all over from scratch. Was at level 187. Also since last 2 updates, any friend functions do not work. I lost ALL my friends with the latest update too. So much for the fix. When it works ill give game 5 stars again.                    Melissa Hudson          When i started playing this i never found instructions,  just winged it. I mean finding the items is pretty self explanatory.  But at first i had no idea what the useful tools did. I always see " if you need help, a friend can leave hints on your table". Really? How? Still haven't figured that one out.           Oh if I never found this game, I would get so much more done. Love it! I play on 2 tablets, 2 separate games.                    Angela Price          I'm really enjoying the game. The puzzles are pretty difficult, and maybe that's the reason I like it so much. You really have to search really hard to find the items. But sometimes I wish that they were a little bit easier so I won't have to use my tools most of the time. Other than that, I enjoy it. Keep up the great work!                    Judian Shardlow          I too am not able to connect to my friends. This has made the game no fun at all! I play other G5 Games & this one has been my favorite up until the last update. Now I'm considering uninstalling it. Maybe that's what G5 is hoping we all do because they can make much more money from their new games. Just a thought!!

Feel sorry for the fools who spent money on this game. If the game has reached end-of-life just say so. Games are to be fun to play not frustrating because they don't work. Software bugs happen and fixing them is nornal - ignoring them is apathetic or arrogant. Perhaps G5 is trying to support too many apps.   Full Review                    DJ Ex  April 4, 2017                       Update: 04/04/17 Servers appear to be synched. All friends recovered. Thanks to the techs who went honey badger I this issue! Old news: What's the point in fixing the server issue when you lose all your friends? Especially when the invite never updates, and resets the timer on every launch. Not to mention the pending tab never updates. Bad form g5, bad form.   Full Review                    Sheila Brown  April 29, 2017                       Come join me and you will find yourself addicted to seeking out hidden articles in the photographs at the mansion of my Uncle Richard. You will not find a more challenging place to search out articles!                                          In case you can't tell I truly like this game!  I have it on downloaded on my laptop, Android and if I had an iPad I would have it there too.It helps keep this old mind sharp. I love a challenge, I also like helping others.   Full Review                    Leslie Ponshock  April 1, 2017                       Since the latest update all my friends are wiped out.  Can't send or receive gifts.   This is ridiculous and should be fixed immediately.  I'll change my rating when the problems are resolved.  Updates should b e thoroughly tested before release.  More things go wrong when an update is released to fix a problem than were present in the first place.   This is unacceptable   Full Review                    April 24, 2017                       UPDATE: 4-24-17 P roblem listed below still NOT fixed. UPDATE: 4-11-17. Whay cant I add friends? I add and gift new friends and all seems fine, but when I go back to the game a second time they are all gone. What happened? Why cant I add and keep friends? Why do they disappear like that? UPDATE: 4-3-17. My friends list is back, but MANY ARE STILL MISSING. When might I be able to get them all back? UPDATE: I have now lost all my friends due to g5e's error. I had hundreds of friends, but now they are all gone thanks to them. I am now royally PO'ed. How in the H will I get them all back??? I believe great compensation is in order.   Full Review                    Maureen XO  April 1, 2017                       Great game up until now. My friends list is suddenly empty...ALL GONE, just like that!!! What is going on??? It was bad enough not being able to send gifts to friends at all for several days now because of a "server" problem but this just ruined the game for me. If this isn't fixed soon I guess I'll be done with the game.   Full Review                    Jennifer Tucker  April 5, 2017                       Loved this game until the most recent update. Now it wont connect to the server and if for some reason it does, i cant access my friends. They are all gone. I cant visit anyone, add new friends, send or receive gifts. Previously rated a 5 and now i give a 1 until the issue is fixed. This is ridiculous. Over a week now since the update and nothing works. Everything was fine before the update that "fixed" the bugs. Bugs that never presented with any issues. Unlike this crap update.   Full Review                    Alisha  April 6, 2017                       Updated - all issues fixed without an update. Don't know how ya did it but my review went from 5 to 1 and now back to 5 stars! K wait- here I am 2 days later and rating's back to 2. Can't interact with friends anymore. I'm not reviewing anymore. Is pointless.   Full Review                    Mosh Pit Michi  April 28, 2017                       Eternally glitched. Needs serious fixing. Have at least 15 friends who do not show on list. Have had many others simply vanish.   Other than that: can't transfer from one device to another or recover if device stolen/broken/lost (I won't make it to a high lvl to go back to zero again); limit on gift is ridiculous, only 50 free and 10 collection, yet you get awards for adding friends, one gift a day per friend would be a reasonable thing.   Full Review                    Brenda Hanlon  April 1, 2017                       Once again an update has created problems with game play. Can't visit friends which is the most recent problem fixed and is now back again. So many issues with this game. Will they ever get the issue resolved? Very disappointed. Lost all friends also. Ridiculous!   Full Review                    Louise Adkins  April 2, 2017                       Dont use this game. I am level 166. The game crashed over  a week ago. We cannot connect to the server. Beyond frustrating that none of the updates they have done have fixed this. None. I've been playing for over a year but right now I can not recommend this product. Friends are all gone. Aviation museum has been stuck in the same modes for 4 days, except the one i need. I wish I could give this game a negative 5. Sad, because this game was awesome. Was. Not now.   Full Review                    Maalu Kautonen  April 7, 2017                       Used to be great. Since a week ago no access to server hence have not been able to visit friends nor gift or receive gifts. Today the game prompted me to update. After the update I lost all my friends, some 150 of them. Total fail of MyTona/G5.   Full Review                    Terri Smith  March 29, 2017                       I love this game.  Its really a long playing game.  Don't start if you don't plan n spending lots of time on it.  I've been playing this game since 2013.  I play at least twice a day every day.  I've been having issues lately, though, it will not connect to the internet.  I've trouble shoot every thing I can think of to fix this.  I can't send or receive gifts with friends, this is very annoying.  Help.   Full Review                    Louise Mitchell  March 31, 2017                       I love the game. The only thing is I haven't been able to get into my friends place in about a month now. Then I try again today and now all my friends are gone. It says I don't have any friends now. What happened to them all. This is crazy it took me long enough to get the one's I had. Please fix this and put my friends back.   Full Review                    Sisela Bok  April 7, 2017                       Glad to see that my friends are all back, it's still a bit laggy from time to time especially the gifts are taking a long time to load. Discovered a new bug: when I buy tools it doesn't always seem to be adding to my inventory, annoying bug. But still from 1 star to 3, keep up the good work!   Full Review                    Sabrina Welch  April 30, 2017                       4.30.2017 Still having friends list issues... can't get over 400 when I know I've added at least 25 over the last week. It will go to 401 and then back down to 400 the next time I look. A tad on the annoying side. Great other than that.   Full Review                    Sammi Clarke  March 31, 2017                       Getting so fed up with this game and the issues with visiting friends. Been playing for a year and it's been brilliant. But rubbish now. Takes ages for lives to restore and takes ages to find anything in the pictures. Dropped my rating to one star. Sort it out G5!!!!   Full Review                    Shanti Keyz  April 1, 2017                       April 1. Gifts were back. Friends were back. Then friends disappeared. I gave 4 diamonds to do an invite of friends and it took those 4 diamond but no friends to invite showed up!!!! Game still broken!!!!! Fix this or a lot of people will be leaving G5. Look at all the complaints. I've spent real cash on this game and so have others. This isn't right.   Full Review                    Dawn Blevings  April 5, 2017                       This game was great before the last few updates. Now I  can not visit friends, send or receive gifts. Sometimes I  can not even see my friend list. Without giving and receiving gifts, and the ability to visit friends......the game is not fun to play. I also think that it is funny that I am connected to the Internet well enough that you ask me to rate the game, but not connected well enough to PLAY the game????? Please fix!!!!!   Full Review                    Lori McGaughey  April 29, 2017                       This has been my favorite free game for several months now. It is interesting, complex, and just the right amount of challenging. I even played through the time the game was having difficulty with the friends part of the game.  Unfortunately, the ads have gone from annoying to down right obnoxious!  To the point that I cannot enjoy playing the game.  They try to trick you into clicking on the ads by having them pop up just as you are clicking a button to continue the game.  For crying out loud, just let me play the game!   Full Review                    RoadRunner Holndr  March 29, 2017                       TOO MANY POP UPS but I don't mean ads. Server fails alot, doesn't affect the game only can't send gifts to friends! It says "it's your lucky day" ALL THE TIME!! And they bug u to buy in game stuff! HATE THAT!!   Full Review                    Jennifer Burton  March 30, 2017                       Fix the server how hard could it be.?I know IT guys looking  for work want their resume? Game getting bad review. Everytime you update I seem to have a problem. My phone is newer and can handle most anything. Done ranting please fix. Obviously it's not just me read the thousands of reviews.

Full Review                    Raeco Dalzell  April 2, 2017                       My friends now disappeared. After the recent update it now shows NO internet connection in order to send or receive friends gifts. Would be better if you could zoom it on a tablet or computer since its made for phone. Objects are hard to find and puts you at a disadvantage. Please fix this soon.   Full Review                    Tami Bretz  April 7, 2017                       Now, i dislike your company even more. I have been playing secret society for a long time. It just up and quit, ERASING all of MY HARD WORK. What a shame. I gave you a second chance and you blew it! I used to love this game, until I got my new tablet!  You have to start over! Your game can't ever be used on another device.  So if you ever plan on changing devices , don't start playing this game!   Full Review                    Julie Lohmann  April 2, 2017                       Love the app and the challenges. Very glitchy when visiting friends, often says cannot connect to server even though server is connected. All my friends disappeared this week even though it says the game has been fixed. Now i cant visit friends bacause they dont exist. Very frustrating!   Full Review                    Stephanie Theophilopoulos  April 2, 2017                       Have been playing for over a year and love it. But in the past few weeks it hasn't been connecting to the server. I wasn't able to send or receive gifts. Then it was fine for one day and now my friends list is blank so I can't send gifts although I do receive them. This needs to be fixed asap.   Full Review                    Darryn DiFrancesco  April 17, 2017                       This is a pretty good game but it seems to penalize you if you become too good and don't need to spend money.  I had to play one scene 8 times to gain object.  That's too many. I'll occasionally buy items but am not going to overspend.  If things don't change I will delete the game.  There are plenty of other things to do. Update 8/9 just solved the gem match board 14 times w/o gaining object.  Unacceptable.  Money sucker. Update 10/24. Level 60. Have now successfully solved 34 puzzles in a row no prize.   Full Review                    Beth Pettis  April 5, 2017                       Thank you for fixing the friends list issue!    I love the game. Only one I play regularly. However I wish the they would allow you to gift all the friends on friend list or you should be able to gift the same amount of collection pieces as the free gifts especially since they come out of your personal inventory.   Full Review                    March 29, 2017                       I haven't been able to log onto the server for 4 days. This cuts into leveling with help from friends and getting gifts for collections and therefore artifacts. I've tweeted and emailed developers to no avail. Will spend my $ elsewhere since they don't think customers matter.   Full Review                    Cynthia Wood  March 30, 2017                       Great game but the gift giving limit is mean... It wants you to have thousands of friends but limits you to only sending fifty gifts per day!!! That's rude if you ask me!!! I'm wanting to quit since it "cannot connect to server"!!! I was already irritated about the lack of friends, but now I have none and completely furious!!!

Full Review                    Angela Kostyk  April 4, 2017                       I dig this game had it on my phone up to level 100+ had to switch phones and apparently there's no way to restore your old information. Was linked with Facebook and all that. Tried to email to see if it could be resolved no response. The game however is awesome.
