We have seen several reasons why cricket has been interrupted. Be it bees flying around the ground or a dog entering the match. Forget animals, even rains have disrupted the game abruptly several times. But ever heard climatic change affecting cricket? Yes, dozens of cricket stadiums are being affected by climatic change with floods filling up cricket grounds due to heavy storm. However, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is responding to the climate change by making Lord’s the first ground in the country to run on 100 per cent renewable energy. The storms that occurred during September 2015, caused damage of more than 3.5 million pounds. Delhi’s Mohit Ahlawat becomes first batsman to score 300 in T20 cricket
Following the storm, several parts of the country continued to witness heavy rainfall. Many scientists have attributed these changes to the climate. One of the cricket clubs that was deeply affected was Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire and Appleby Eden in Cumbria. Some of the cricket clubs have been demolished due to the storm like the 130-year-old Corbridge Cricket Club’s historic clubhouse at The Stanners, Nothemberland was one of them. The England and Wales Cricket Board have provided a helping hand funding 1 million pounds for the cricket clubs that were affected. In 2016, they extended their support further providing 1.6 million pounds.
The new Warner stand at the Lord’s which is to unveiled on May, will be heated by a ground source heat pump that will extract energy from water that will be pumped from 200m down in an aquifer under the ground, as reported by thetimes.co.uk. Lord’s have made complete preparation for the climatic change by including photovoltaic solar roof panels, solar thermal technology and water collection and recycling system in the new Warner stand.
On the climatic change, Piers Forster, director of Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds, said, “UK weather will always bowl us the odd googly, but climate change is making them harder to defend against.”
