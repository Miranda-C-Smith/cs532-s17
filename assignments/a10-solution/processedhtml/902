I was super excited. In smaller towns if any big film does not releases through this we can create the screenings.   But here is the heads up.  I created the screening even though 19 people were required it cancelled because 19 people did not come.   If you have developed this concept you should also share the screening through pvrcinemas facebook page,twitter page so that more can come to know about this.  If you yourself Will not make it publicly aware then the screenings criteria will not be fulfilled. I have closely looked at all the screenings created in the cities. Majority has been cancelled,why? Minimum people not showed up.   Also noticed same person has created many many screenings in different cities, may be your guy.   I have lost interest now. I may as well uninstall the app,sorry. Such a great concept but no use for a movie buff like me.   One more thing: I HAVE MAILED YOU GUYS LIKE 4 TIMES. NOT A SINGLE REPLY. SHOWS HOW NO ONE IS GIVING A DAMN ABOUT IT.   GOOD LUCK.

Full Review                    Krushnaal Pai  January 20, 2017                       Nice concept but practically I don't think it will work. I personally feel you should tie-up with all other cinema owners like Inox, Big Cinemas, E-Square, Cinepolis and start a Netflix like service where you charge Rs. 500 per month. In this model a user can watch any new movie that hits the theatres any number of times in any theatre of his/her choice, basically it's like a monthly bus/train pass. To prevent abuse, you should block users for that particular month in which they fail to attend the screening more than once.
