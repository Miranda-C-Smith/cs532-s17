What's This?

While it's true A Walk To Remember wasn't exactly good, the 2002 film about a young woman with leukemia (Mandy Moore) and her whirlwind relationship with the love of her life (Shane West), stills holds a very special place in people's hearts.
So it's no surprise that a mini-reunion of the romantic yet death-obsessed film's cast and crew has got Instagram all in a flutter — and feeling more than a little nostalgic.

Moore had been teasing a Walk To Remember get-together for a few weeks, recently taking to her Twitter to answer questions about the now 15-year-old film. Yep, you're getting old.

It was then that a fan asked about the possibility of a reunion. Moore's response was swift.

We're working on it!  https://t.co/JRTPPaaHKZ

Well, turns out Moore didn't have to work on it very hard: Less than a fortnight later, she posted this adorable snap on her Instagram Monday.

That's the film's director Adam Shankman in the middle. Not to be outdone, Shankman posted a photo of the meet-up on his Instagram as well.


Over 3 hour catch up dinner with @mandymooremm and @theshanewest . After 15 years their love is still like the wind: i cant see it but i will always feel it. Love u guys soooo much. #awtrreunion #AWalkToRemember #proudpapa.

Everyone has aged remarkably well. Moore looks like the last decade and a half means nothin' to her, and ol' mate Shane West is as gorgeous as ever.
Obviously God has a plan for these two, and it involves keeping them good looking.
