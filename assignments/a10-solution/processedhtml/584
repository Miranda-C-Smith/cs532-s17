Hello there! If you are new here, you might want to subscribe to the RSS feed for updates!












So the most famous pre-roll advertiser on the planet has just released their latest incarnation of the ads. And of course, they are great! Similarly to the previous rounds, they start by saying what they are going to do, and in this case, it’s “crushing” the ads into smaller formats. Enjoy!
