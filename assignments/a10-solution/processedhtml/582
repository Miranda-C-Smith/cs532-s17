FarmVille was fun....

    FarmVille is one of the most fun games I've played.  I love the farm animals and the missions. It keeps you busy for a long time. There are a variety of things to make and produce, and they aren't complicated or take long too. I was enjoying it until now. When I got into the game today, it said there were improvements and that I needed to upgrade it. So I went to the App Store and tried to upgrade it, but there was no way to do it. I went back and forth from the game to the App Store three more times, but still nothing. I don't know if this is Zyngas fault, but I'm very disappointed because I can't play. Please do something about it!! Also, I find it hard to get keys. Is there any way to get keys without spending moola? I'm irritated because producing stuff takes long now. Mostly just garden tools. And pastries from the pastry oven. Zynga please fix this!
  



Cheating

    I agree the cheating is abhorrent in this game.  Those of us who don't cheat pay the price. There is NO possible way to get 21,000,000,000 + score in this game even if you play 24x7.  If you don't stop the cheating I'm stopping my monetary and time investment in this game.  I will find some other non-King game to invest my spare fun time in.  I hope the cheaters drive everyone away and you are left with cheaters only.  Anyone can acquire cheat programs, they are a dime a dozen and they are free.  All reputable games have programs that ban all cheaters and refuse to ever let them play any games that corporation has. I thought King was a responsible honest gaming corporation.  I will see, if not I'm gone!
  



Very fun!

    This game is fun and I can even play it with my family! Always something to do. Not like a lot of other games of this type where you get to higher levels and end up just waiting for things to upgrade or finish. Those kind I end up losing interest because I have nothing to do and wait so long I forget about the game completely. This one is fun and keeps me going for hours! Many options of ways to make money or xp! Good graphics and lots of fun! Very well done! The only game by them that I actually like.
