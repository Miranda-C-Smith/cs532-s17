We are getting tremendous response, Thanks to all of you! We would like to try to explain a little more about our product as we are finding that some people are very particular about their toilet paper. First, Purrrfect is a recycled option and compares favorably to brands like scott, pom, marathon, and georgia pacific. In fact Purrrfect is much thicker than these brands and has a light floral pattern embossed on it for some texture. Second, Purrrfect Toilet paper is NOT a cotton type toilet paper product like charmin, cottonelle, or angelsoft. These are not recycled products nor can cotton be recycled for this purpose. You will not find a recycled Bathroom tissue in this style. Third, Purrrfect is much more durable and is in a larger roll than other recycled brands like seventh generation, green forest or marcal. We think some of these seem like they are filled with air! So, please, if you have any questions just email us or message us through amazon. We want you to be happy, while you help the earth to be happy. All the packaging is 100% recycled and recyclable! We will do all we can to win your business and earn your respect. We are a 100% American owned and operated company. Give us a try Today! Want to buy in bulk? See the special offers section where you save 5% on 2 packs, 10% on 3, and 15% on 4. Plus if you buy 4 packs we will send you a coupon code for $10. off your next order of 4! (for a limited time only while supplies last)

I'll buy whatever for paper towels, tissues, napkins, but I don't skimp on toilet paper. I think this Purrrfect toilet paper is great.  I've used other eco-friendly brands and they feel like sand paper. But this brand manages to still be soft. The toughness is good too. The TP they use at my work might be tissue paper. You practically have to use half a roll to get the job done. With Purrrfect I found that I don't need much.  Just three squares will do it.Read more0Comment|

      Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsPlastic, plastic, plasticByDuchesson February 16, 2017Package Quantity: 24|Verified PurchaseMy family really hates this toilet paper!This morning when I went to use the humorously large inner core as kindling in my woodstove it crossed another line of hatred, it too is coated in plastic and filled my living room with burning plastic fumes!  The inner core is a full 0.5 cm larger in diameter than 7th Generation and the paper is visibly less when compared side by side.As others have written, the product does not come as photographed in the listing.  Each roll is individually wrapped in plastic and the whole is then sealed in a thick plastic bag.  I emailed the company to see if the plastic wrappers are recyclable or biodegradable and still haven't received an answer back and it's been about a month.The paper is very strong and it is impossible to tear cleanly at the perforation, it shreds every time, even if I use two hands and carefully pull.I think it is absorbent and I haven't had any performance issues like others have noted... if anything it's too strong and stiff more like a Seventh Generation brown paper towel.This product is certainly not eco-friendly by any stretch other than the fact the the paper itself is recycled. Clearly the center roll is not and the packaging makes it a plastic s**t storm. I am very disappointed with this purchase.Read more

Normally that means very thin and rough.  I was surprised that this was was not too rough and was thicker I would def buy this one.  I also love that its safe for septic systems living in CO a lot of people out here have septic systems and they have learned the wrong toilet paper can mean a big disaster.Read more0Comment|

Like other customers said, the toilet paper arrived in plastic and then each roll wrapped individually in more plastic. The toilet paper seems thick enough and soft but is fall-apart mushy when wet. Good for wadding into spitballs, better than 1-ply...otherwise it is not great so I will go back to a more environmental choice.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsI love first of all that a this product because of ...Byshelleon January 2, 2017Package Quantity: 24I love first of all that a this product because of its environmental awareness factor.

      Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsWhen did excessive plastic wrap= eco-friendly?ByC. Braunsteinon December 22, 2016Package Quantity: 24|Verified PurchaseI don't see what possible metric can be used to call this toilet paper eco-friendly, it came packaged in two layers of plastic. Not only was there the normal outside plastic bag, but then each, individual roll of toilet paper was also wrapped in its own plastic wrapper.  Completely not as pictured and left a small hill of plastic in its wake. The actual quality of the TP itself is also meh. Avoid this one if you are purchasing it for it's eco-friendly qualities, because there are zero.Read more11 comment|
