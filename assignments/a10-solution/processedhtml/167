Good! But...

    Although understandably a limited Fire Emblem experience, it takes familiar elements of the core games and made something close to it; overall turning itself into its own game that still feels like FE. The combat is good and the size of the map kind of turns everything more like a puzzle than anything. There are events that generously give orbs for those who prefer to play the game for free, but that's where I feel the problem lies. Acquiring heroes seems to be the core mechanic of this game; for upgrading, gaining skills, all that jazz; but getting heroes feel slow given the only way to get them is through orbs. (Seeing aside some events) Sure one can hasten this by purchasing orbs, but even that doesn't feel so rewarding when its randomness in summoning may not give you your money's worth. Perhaps another currency can be introduced in game that offers a limited roster of heroes, and maybe have an item for those who spend real money that guarantees them at least one 5 star hero. Have the players experience an overflow of heroes so they can start enjoying the management part of the game too. Anyways, overall, the game is fun and well managed with active announcements in game and in social media. It's worth a try for Fire Emblem fans if you haven't yet.
  



My Favorite Mobile Game

    I've been a fan of FE for a long time. This bite sized version is perfect for iPhone. For a free to play game there is a lot to do and tons of replay value. A common complaint is the drop rates of high star characters in the Summon function. This seems silly to me as a higher drop rate would make this game pointless. It is possible to amass a good deal of orbs without spending a penny if you work on quests and log in every day. I just summoned 5 Star Ike after burning 160 orbs. Every time you summon without receiving a 5 star the drop rate improves until you summon your next five star or that particular summon event ends. It is to your advantage to horde orbs for a while and use them when there is a summoning event that has focus characters you want. If you just burn them as soon as you get to 20 (never burn less than 20 at a time) then you are wasting them in my opinion.  This mechanic as well as the fact you earn feathers a number of ways that allow you to increase the stars of a character make the acquisition rates fair in my opinion. Also, this is a free to play game. If you care that much spend some money for more orbs. Support Nintendo so they keep making great games.
  



Excellent Addition to the Franchise

    Fire Emblem is my favorite Nintendo franchise, which is really saying something; I've logged over a thousand hours in Awakening and Fates during the past year. Naturally, with my high expectations, I approached the announcement of a mobile game with some trepidation.I've been surprisingly impressed with this game! The art, with a few exceptions (I'm looking at you, Cordelia and Arthur) is excellent, and I'm so happy that a lot of the voice actors came back for their respective characters. I love that new characters are introduced during special events, and that there was an event for Easter; I hope there are more holiday events in the future! I wonder if the developers would consider introducing child units from Awakening and Fates, as well. Personally, I'd kill to summon characters like Gerome, Shigure, and Kiragi. Also, let's bring in some more Awakening characters! I want to see fighters like Libra, Ricken, and Miriel joining the fray. What's exciting is that we have no idea who the developers are going to give us next, and that's part of what makes the game so addictive.UPDATE: Stamina increased to a cap of 99? Hero Feather Merit? Sacred Seals? Awesome, awesome, awesome. Best mobile game ever.
