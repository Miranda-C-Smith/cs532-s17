Democratic Senators are trying to convince at least one more Republican to join the two GOP Senators who last week announced they will vote against Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump's nominee to become Secretary of Education. DeVos, an anti-public schools activist, is exceptionally not qualified to run the Dept. of Education, as she all too clearly showed during her confirmation hearing.
Calling today's action a "rare move," Mother Jones reports the vote on DeVos, which has already been postponed several times, will now take place Tuesday.
You can urge your U.S. Senators to vote "no" on Betsy DeVos by calling the U.S. Capitol Switchboard: (202) 224- 3121. 
You don't need to know your Senators' names, just the state in which you reside/vote. They will put you through. It's vital you take the time to call, even if your Senator has declared their position yes yes or no – as these numbers need to be seen as a people's protest. And you never know. Maybe another Republican will break ranks and "no" too.
