      iTunes Review
    
6LACK‚Äôs moody, seductive first album establishes him as one of the sharpest voices in R&B. Though often compared to The Weeknd, the Atlanta singer‚Äôs sound is both headier and more ethereal, mixing spacious, bass-heavy beats with the knocked-out reflections of Future and Young Thug. Most intoxicating is this set‚Äôs atmosphere, which makes highlights like ‚ÄúPRBLMS‚Äù and ‚ÄúEx Calling‚Äù stand out like waves rippling through a dark ocean.

    If you read any review read this one. I never do these but this man deserves it! He is dedicated to his fans and producing good music, the way he likes to do it. The moment I heard Prblms I was hooked. He is incomparable to any other modern day R&B artist. We freed this man, and now he's hungry for quality. Thank you bear.

Born: June 24, 1992 in Atlanta, GAGenre: R&B/SoulYears Active:  '10sDazed slow jams are the primary mode of Atlanta-based contemporary R&B;/rap artist Ricardo Valentine, a singer-slash-MC who goes by the name 6LACK ("black"). Prior to connecting with LVRN (Love Renaissance), the creative agency that has supported fellow Georgia native Raury, Valentine was signed to a label that he felt restricted his creativity.
