(AP/MEREDITH) -- The Flamin' Hot Cheeto that resembled Harambe the gorilla has sold for nearly $100,000 on eBay.Bidding on the cheese snack the seller said he found in a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos began at $11.99 on Jan. 28. It ended early Tuesday morning with a winning bid of $99,900. The listing showed a picture of the Cheeto side-by-side with a gorilla climbing a tree.Ever since being killed after grabbing a child that fell into his pen at the Cincinnati Zoo, Harambe has been a hero of Internet memes, immortalized as a cultural icon and reaching near-deity status. And now he could become the savior of one seller’s bank account.If you want your chance to bid on a Cheeto that looks like a famous gorilla, you better hurry. Bidding ends early Tuesday morning.Copyright 2017 (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
