Is God Calling You?
Alfred E Carrozzo 

















At this very minute God IS calling a people out of this sin-sick and dying world. It is a wonderful calling for a fantastic purpose. It is so awe-inspiring that some have difficulty believing it. Perhaps YOU are being called right now. You need to know, lest you ignore a direct call from the great God of all the universe. Read this article to find out whether God is calling YOU!!     THE COMMON idea of today's Christian  world is that a battle is  taking place between God and  Satan. The idea teaches that God is trying  to get everyone saved, and Satan is  trying to get everyone lost. If that be  true, then every honest person will have  to admit GOD IS LOSING!     The vast majority of all people on  earth today do  not even profess  Christianity.  Yet, your Bible  says there is no other name under heaven through which we can be  saved (Acts 4:12). Many millions of  people have lived and died without  ever hearing the name of Jesus Christ.  What about those people? What about — A  little babies that live only a few hours?  Has God caused them to be doomed?  What about the millions living under  atheistic Communism? Are they lost  forever?     ABSOLUTELY NOT! EVERYONE will  have a chance!  Specific Calling Necessary     The shocking fact is, God is not trying  to get everyone saved now!  It is a lack of understanding of God's  plan that causes the evangelists to  shout: "Give your heart to the Lord  before it's too late!" The inspired  Word of God reveals that NO ONE can  come to Jesus Christ UNLESS THE FATHER SPECIFICALLY CALLS HIM (John 6:44).     In other words, this IS NOT THE  ONLY DAY OF SALVATION!! This is an  absolute fact of your Bible.     All those who are not now called, or  given a chance for salvation, will come  up in the second resurrection. They will  come up as physical human beings and  be given their one and only chance for  salvation. This resurrection takes place  one thousand years later, after what  Bible students call "the millennium."     Most professing Christians are in  ignorance of this basic truth. Why such  ignorance in an enlightened age? Why  can't a people who bear the name  "Christian" understand the simple  statements of the One whom they claim  to follow? It was Jesus Christ who said  to His disciples: "... It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom  of heaven, but to them it is not  given" (Matt. 13:11). He explained to  His intimate followers that they had  been called. He said: "... I have chosen  you out of the world" (John 15:19).     The Bible is filled with positive  PROOF that all Christians must receive a  divine call from God.  Understanding Clouded     Astounding as it may seem, God has  deliberately clouded the meaning of His  message so the vast majority cannot  understand. God explains in Isaiah  28:10-13: "For precept must be upon  precept, precept upon precept; line upon  line, line upon line; here a little, and  there a little... that they might go, and  fall backward, and be broken, and  snared, and taken."     God purposely wrote His Word so  that it could be misunderstood. He  intended that only those whom He is  calling and choosing will understand.     Do you understand God's Word? Is  God calling yon? How can you know?  How God Calls and Chooses     Many misunderstand how God calls.  Some feel God calls by means of an  audible voice. Others feel it is done by  drastic intervention, such as accidents or  fires. Still others desire a "good feeling  all over" to be assured of a calling.     What is the truth? How does God  call? Have you been called and chosen of God? The answer is really very easy  to understand. Simply stated, God calls  by His Gospel and through the Power  of His Holy Spirit.     The Gospel is the good news of the  coming government of God and is  recorded in the Bible — God's Word to  mankind. Through the power of His  Holy Spirit, God opens the minds of  those He is calling so they can understand  the plain truths of His Gospel message. God's Spirit begins to work in a special way with those whom He is  calling.  What God's Spirit Will Do     How is the Spirit of God manifested  in those whom He is calling? How does  the Spirit of God work upon and  through the human mind?     Initially, the Spirit of God will lead the one being called to believe He  exists! In this age of skepticism and  doubt, it is chic to deny the existence of  God. But if God's Spirit is working  with you, it will be impossible for you  to deny God's existence. It is a sign that  God may be calling you!     Also, God's Spirit will guide you to  prove and profoundly believe the Bible  is the inspired Word of Gad — God's  Instruction Book to mankind. God's  Spirit will lead you to know, "All scripture  is given by inspiration of God, and  is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,  for correction, for instruction in righteousness"! (II Tim. 3:16.)     How can anyone really believe the  Bible if he feels portions are uninspired?  Yet, this is exactly what many  "Christians," so called, believe today!  Some regard the Old Testament purely  as historical literature. Some go so far as  to teach that the hook of Revelation is  the writing of a man obsessed with  hallucinations.     Others say only the epistles of Paul  should be accepted. WHAT NONSENSE!     All this doctrinal confusion is a  direct result of choosing certain portions  of the Bible to believe — refusing to  accept all Scripture as given by inspiration  of God.     We either believe ALL the Bible, or  none of it. It's as simple as that. JESUS  Christ said: "The scripture cannot be  broken" (John 10:35). He said the  Scriptures make a complete chain — they do not contradict one another. Yet,  books have been written to expose  assumed Bible contradictions. But Jesus  said Scripture does not contradict itself.     Every supposed contradiction is the  result of either a mistranslation or a  misinterpretation. Unless you approach  the Scriptures with this truth, you  cannot hope to grasp the full meaning  of God's Word. You will fool yourself  into believing the Bible is full of contradictions  and cannot be depended  upon.     If you believe the Bible is God's  Word — that all Scripture is given by  inspiration of God — and that "the  scripture cannot be broken," God may  be calling you!     Another way God's Spirit guides  those whom God is calling is to inspire  them to take God at His word — believe He says what He means and  means what He says. Those whom God  is calling through His Holy Spirit will  believe the simple statements recorded  in the Bible without coloring them with  a myriad of preconceived ideas.     If God is calling you, His Spirit will  lead you to believe Christ did not come  to do away with God's Law but to fulfill  and perform it (Matt. 5:17). You  will believe the Kingdom of Heaven is  not in heaven, but here on earth. You  will believe the plain statement that the  meek shall inherit the earth — not  heaven (Matt. 5:3, 5).     If God's Spirit is working with you  and calling you, you will reject the  pagan idea of an immortal soul. You  will believe the statement in Ezekiel  18:4, 20, that the soul is not immortal  but can die! (Read our FREE reprint,  "Do You Have an Immortal Soul??")     You will begin to understand that  virtually everything you have hem  taught about the Bible is probably the  antithesis of the actual truth. Space will  permit only the above few examples,  but there are many dozens and scores of  misunderstandings about what God  actually says which could he pointed  out.     If the Spirit of God is leading you, it  will direct you to understand the plain  truths of His Word.     In addition, God's Spirit will show  you that you should NEVER try to interpret  the Bible: "... No prophecy of the  scripture is of any private interpretation"  (II Peter 1:20).     Many cannot understand Scripture  because the): have not learned the Bible  interprets itself! Many supposed contradictions  occur because men have not  learned to let the Bible interpret itself.  Through diligent and earnest study, we  can understand perplexing verses only  in the light of other scriptures.     For example, Revelation 12:3 mentions  a "great red dragon" with seven  heads and ten horns. There have been  many interpretations of this verse. Some  say the dragon is the false prophet.  Others say it is the beast. Still others  claim the dragon is mysterious symbolism  picturing Red Russia or some  form of Communism. But none of these  interpretations is right.     God doesn't tell us in verse three what the great red dragon is. Reading  verse three alone we would have to conclude  we just don't know. Or we would  have to come up with an interpretation.  Or we could LET THE BIBLE INTERPRET  ITSELF!     If we choose to let the Bible interpret  itself, all we need do to KNOW what the  red dragon represents is to read verse  nine. In verse nine God reveals that the  dragon is "that old serpent, called the  Devil, and Satan."     If God is calling you, His Spirit will  eventually lead you to believe every  statement of the Bible, and you will let  the Bible interpret itself! But this isn't  all.     God's Spirit will lead those whom  He is calling to LIVE BY EVERY WORD  OF GOD! (Matt. 4:4.) To really understand  the Bible, it is paramount to live  by every word of God, not just some  portions or pet doctrines. Most professing  Christians accept some Bible truths,  but for the most part, they walk in dismal  error. How can they live by the  Word of God when they don't even  know what it says? It is an appalling  fact that the majority of professing  Christians can't even name the first four  books of the New Testament — the  four Gospel accounts — the Gospel  which they must believe!     Candidly speaking, nearly ALL professing  Christians are NOT WILLING to  live by every word of God. Some deliberately  reject all but a relatively small  portion which has no bearing on their  personal lives. God gives understanding  only to those who are willing to live by  all of His Word!     Another way God uses His Spirit to  call His people is by convicting and  convincing them of His way. If God is  calling you, you will begin to fully  understand the Bible for the first time.  You will begin to read and study the  Bible with the appetite of a starving  giant. And you will come to see there is  a way that seems right to a man but  ends in death (Prov. 14:12).     Man's way is the grasping, greedy,  selfish way of "getting." It is a "do  unto others before they have a chance to  do it unto you" philosophy. It is the  way of lust, envy, strife, murder,  jealousy, wrath, drunkenness, revelings  and the like. It is the cause of all man's troubles, heartaches and sorrows. It is  the reason for the wretched conditions  we see on earth today.     If God is calling you, His Spirit will  convince you to begin to candidly, honestly,  wholeheartedly admit you have  been going man's way, the way that  leads to death. You will begin to dedicate  your whole life to God and His  way. You will say, and mean it, "Thy  will be done." You will repent!     Through Bible study and close contact  with God, you will begin to see the  whole world really is on' the brink of  cosmocide because of man's way. You  will come to know assuredly man is  reaching the end of his rope. Man desperately  needs help. And God is the  only one who really has the answers to  all this world's problems.     The answer to man's problems is simply  to follow God's way of love — the  way of outgoing concern — the way of  giving, sharing, helping — the way of  doing unto others as you would have  them do unto you. It is the way to real  happiness, joy, peace, contentment — the way of gentleness, goodness, meekness  and self-control. It is based on the  principle Christ gave to His disciples  that it is more blessed to give than to  receive.     If God is calling, convicting and convincing  you of His way, you will begin  to have inner peace. You will begin to  fully trust God to solve the world's  problems through His way of love. You  will know and realize God truly has the  answers. You will rejoice in the fact  that God is giving the answers to those  He is calling.     And then you will begin to comprehend  that God is calling some now  for a specific purpose. You will realize  it is a specific calling for a specific  Work. It is a special commission. It is a  commission to preach the true Gospel of  the Kingdom of God to all the world as  a witness before the end of this age. It  is a commission to teach all nations to  believe everything Jesus Christ has commanded  His true followers. It is a commission  and a Work designed to turn  the hearts of the fathers to the children,  and the hearts of the children to their  fathers to keep mankind from destroying  himself! (Matt. 24:14, 21, 22 and Mal. 4:6.)     If God is calling you, you will begin  to wholeheartedly have a part in doing  His Work. You will realize this tremendous  knowledge of God's way is  desperately needed by all the world.  You will come to fully understand and  know God's own physical people are  actually being destroyed for a lack of  this knowledge (Hosea 4:6). You will  see the urgent need to have a part in  the very Work that is disseminating  this vital knowledge — this Gospel  message of God's way to all the world.  You will zealously take part in the  Work that is teaching all nations the  way of peace, happiness and joy brimful  and running over.     You will have the desire to GIVE, to  share with and to help this wretched  world. You will put your whole heart  into God's Work. You will completely  dedicate yourself to having a part in  warning the world of the dramatic  events to occur just before the close of  this age. Soon you will realize nothing  else matters.     This world is lost in a hopeless  morass of confusion, wretchedness and  depravity. Any thinking person will  admit it can't go on much longer. You  can have a part in telling the world  today about the wonderful World  Tomorrow. If God is calling you, you  can rejoice in the fact that you can help  spread the knowledge to all the world  that God Himself is going to intervene  in the affairs of mankind and save the  world. You will be thrilled to have a  part in telling the world there is a better  tomorrow — that God does care — that God will act.     And when you think how upside down  marriages can be put right-side  up, how you can have a part in turning  the hearts of the fathers to the children,  and the hearts of the children to their  fathers, to bridge the generation gap,  cement the family unit, you will rejoice.     If you have a part in God's Work,  you will take great satisfaction in the  knowledge that you are helping teach  the world how to have happy homes,  happy children, happy marriages and  everything good in a full and abundant,  happy life. You will even be willing to  sacrifice to have a part in helping this  world understand God's way.     If God is calling you, please understand it is a fantastic, almost overwhelming  calling to help save humanity  by sacrificing to give this world what it  needs most — God's way, that leads to  life.  Is God Calling You?     If you, through The WORLD TOMORROW  broadcast, The WORLD TOMORROW  telecast, The PLAIN TRUTH and  the pages of this magazine, are beginning  to believe the Bible means exactly  what it says — if the Gospel message is  perceived by you to be God's personal  message to you — if you see your way  is wrong — if you desire to give, share  and help this world — then YOU ARE  BEING CALLED OF GOD!     You are being called right now  through the pages of this magazine. Are  you going to heed that call? Are you  going to respond to God's Holy Spirit  and accept the truths you have been  receiving?     Are you willing to live by every word  of God — believe the Gospel and  respond to the call from Almighty God  to be among the firstfruits in His  Kingdom?     Remember, those whom God is calling  will have a part in saving this  chaotic world. They will have a part in  preaching this final warning message to  this dying world before the end of this  age. They will have a part in picturing  the wonderful World Tomorrow. They  will have a part in turning "the heart of  the fathers to the children, and the  heart of the children to their fathers"  (Mal. 4:5-6).     And finally, they will have a part in  the Kingdom of God as kings and  priests under Jesus Christ who will be  here on this earth ruling all nations as  King of kings and Lord of lords.     It is a fantastic calling you now have.  No wonder Paul was inspired to write  in Hebrews 2:1-3: "Therefore we ought  to give the more earnest heed to the  things which we have heard, lest at any  time we should let them slip. For if the  word spoken by angels was steadfast,  and every transgression and disobedience  received a just recompence of  reward; how shall we escape, if we  neglect so great salvation."     The call is out! It is a wonderful  calling! You have heard, and read, and  seen. The next move is yours!
