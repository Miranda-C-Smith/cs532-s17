Tobias Harris only scores nine points in the win over Philadelpia

                      By Dennis Sosic, Pistons Correspondent, Mon, Feb 6th 11:54pm EST 

                        Playing in his familiar role as sixth man, Harris came off the bench and played 27 minutes.  He had a poor shooting night as he went 3-of-10 from the field and missed his only three-point attempt.  On the bright side, he was able to pull down eight rebounds. (source)                    

Fantasy ImpactHarris is averaging 16.5 points and 5.1 rebounds so far this season while mostly coming off the bench.  Chalk this one up to just one bad game, hopefully.  Look for him to spark the Pistons off the bench on Wednesday night when the Pistons host the Lakers.
